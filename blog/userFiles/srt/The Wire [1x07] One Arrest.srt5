1
00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:12,609
Low man scrapped, yo.
He all the way down.

2
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:15,676
But we going to start fresh
on the latest tomorrow...

3
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:19,188
-down from up North.
-No problem.

4
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:22,656
-No problem?
-Yeah, yo's talkin' about some guy...

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,660
named Lohman, who's down with strep...

6
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:28,391
-Iike he's sick.
-And the last part?

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,567
And the last part is something about
how he's gonna start up...

8
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:32,863
a Fashion Lady or some shit.

9
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:35,299
-Fashion Lady?
-I'm fluent in the Perkins Homes...

10
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:38,239
and Latrobe Tower dialects,
but I haven't quite mastered...

11
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:39,309
the Franklin Terrace.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,503
He's saying they're sold out
in the low-rises...

13
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:44,206
so tomorrow they're gonna
start fresh with a new package.

14
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:46,510
-That's what you hear?
-Listen again.

15
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:51,281
-Low man scrapped, yo.
-Low man, meaning the low-rise pit.

16
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:56,885
-He all the way down.
-Is down to scraps on the last package.

17
00:00:57,862 --> 00:01:00,160
But we going start fresh
on the latest tomorrow...

18
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:01,356
down from up North.

19
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:03,797
Tomorrow, he'll start
fresh on the latest package.

20
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:05,528
Damn, how you all hear it so good?

21
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:08,104
"Gold Coast slave ship
bound for cotton fields...

22
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:10,197
"sold in a market down in New Orleans."

23
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:11,330
What the fuck is that?

24
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:14,275
Rolling Stones.
First two lines to Brown Sugar.

25
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:18,508
I bet you've heard that song 500 times,
but you never knew, right?

26
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:22,609
I used to put my head to the stereo speaker
and play that record over and over.

27
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,255
That explains a lot, actually.

28
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,661
-So, wait on black, yo?
-What's white on black?

29
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,931
Wait on black, right? Even I heard that shit.

30
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:39,499
Black's code for Stinkum.
We picked that up once we got on his pager.

31
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:43,266
Now, there's gonna be a re-up of
four G-packs in the low-rise court.

32
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:46,638
Stinkum is on the re-up
and it's gonna go down around noon.

33
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:48,211
Are you sure about all that?

34
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:06,323
Turn it upside down.

35
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:12,298
Four hash marks in a row,
one for each G-pack...

36
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:14,330
"LO" for low-rises.

37
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:18,230
-1 2 for the time.
-"S" for Stinkum.

38
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,442
-How long to figure that out?
-Four or five hours.

39
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,508
You sit here looking at beeper messages
for five hours at a time?

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,514
I don't know, it's kinda fun figuring shit out.

41
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,346
You're not helping me out here, Sanny.

42
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:14,117
-Major, l--
-I ask you for one fucking thing....

43
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,989
-I know, but I don't--
-All these months, I'm carrying you.

44
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:20,188
I'm sitting here, watching case
after case stack up, right?

45
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:23,966
These are all yours,
and they're all open, Sanny.

46
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:28,500
Last year, your clearance rate was 40%.
This year, it's less than that.

47
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,307
I caught some tough ones.
There's not a lot of dunkers in there.

48
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,403
Mike, you're good on the dunkers.
I'll give you that.

49
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:39,711
Shit, comes to dunkers,
you solve probably 6, 7 out of 10.

50
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:43,649
-But a stone fucking whodunit?
-That's not a fair assessment, Major.

51
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:46,484
Fair? What the fuck is fair?

52
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:50,388
I got a detective out there, unsupervised,
running his own special ops unit...

53
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:52,462
burning me every chance he gets.

54
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:54,656
It's not my job to fuck another cop.

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,924
Not your job?

56
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:03,005
Tell you what, Detective.
I'm gonna be so fucking fair...

57
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:04,665
I'm gonna give you the choice.

58
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:09,471
Either bring me something on McNulty,
or go out there and do your job.

59
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:13,114
-Pick a file, any file.
-Major--

60
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:14,912
Pick a murder and solve it...

61
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:17,282
or bring me McNulty,
there's no third choice.

62
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:29,556
Stinkum will have a runner with him.
The runner's gonna be holding the package.

63
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:33,103
-When you get them, ride the bumper.
-So he knows we're there?

64
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:37,265
Right. Lay on the blue light if you need it.
Now, the runner's gonna bolt.

65
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,502
-I got the runner, you stay with Stinkum.
-No.

66
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,601
-I got the runner, he takes Stink?
-No.

67
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:43,375
You both take the runner.

68
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,915
-And Stink gets away?
-Nobody gets away.

69
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:49,817
If we pull in Stink on a car stop now,
we got to give up PC...

70
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,081
which means we got to give up the wire.

71
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:55,022
We didn't set all this up
for two days' worth of coke, did we?

72
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,026
We snatch the runner,
stick a hook in him and go back fishing.

73
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,098
And between the wiretap
and the runner bolting from the truck...

74
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:04,099
we got a charge on Stinkum
any time we want it.

75
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:10,767
We're also edging back into old murders,
pulling up fresh witnesses.

76
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,504
And there are assets to be seized,
stuff that fronts for the drug money.

77
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,477
-Like what?
-A strip club...

78
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,038
a couple of Westside laundromats,
a triple-A rated towing company...

79
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:21,345
a funeral parlor.

80
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:25,285
-A funeral parlor?
-He bought out one in Gwynn Falls last year.

81
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,754
The money's going everywhere.

82
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:30,190
That's just what we know from
one of Avon's girls bragging to a friend.

83
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:32,660
God knows what else he's got
that we don't know of.

84
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:33,230
Understand Barksdale's name is on nothing.
He's always a step or two removed.

85
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,461
Understand Barksdale's name is on nothing.
He's always a step or two removed.

86
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,602
It's a career case, Your Honor.

87
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:41,728
Look here, Jimmy.

88
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:45,166
You misspelled "culpable"...

89
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:48,971
and you're confusing "then" and "than."

90
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:53,579
T-H-E-N is an adverb used
to divide and measure time.

91
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:57,985
"Detective McNulty makes a mess...

92
00:06:58,422 --> 00:07:00,686
"and then he has to clean it up."

93
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,952
It's great that you're going through
every word--

94
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,997
Not to be confused with T-H-A-N,
which is most commonly used...

95
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,000
after a comparative adjective or adverb,
as in:

96
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:14,461
"Rhonda is smarter than Jimmy."

97
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,237
Yeah? Look, there is more than enough
indication of progress...

98
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,277
to justify continued intercepts.

99
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:25,542
I'll sign an order
for 30 more days on all taps and clones.

100
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:28,713
One copy to the court,
one to the State's Attorney?

101
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,821
-Anything else you need?
-What, from you?

102
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:41,358
I think I'll go see a man about a dog.

103
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:47,895
It's always a pleasure, Ms. Pearlman.

104
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:53,141
Your professional demeanor
and your overall competence...

105
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:57,338
stands in stark contrast against
the usual municipal backdrop...

106
00:07:57,448 --> 00:08:00,645
of mediocrity and indifference.

107
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,044
-Sarcasm, Judge?
-No.

108
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:06,555
Another 10 years of this nonsense,
and I see you wearing the robes...

109
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,921
of the District Court for Baltimore City.

110
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:14,090
That or a straitjacket.

111
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:22,539
Jesus.

112
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:26,105
I would love to throw a fuck into her.

113
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:29,538
The red hair, freckles....

114
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,106
Don't you think, Jimmy?

115
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:35,652
As in all matters before the Court,
I think whatever the Judge thinks.

116
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,110
Come on, Jimmy.

117
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:41,549
Sit. Talk.

118
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,006
-1 2-14.
-What's up?

119
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:02,579
Eastbound on Preston.
Stinkum and a young boy riding shotgun.

120
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,875
They're at the light right now.

121
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:19,996
Got them.

122
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:38,877
Let's see how he plays it.

123
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,449
Fucking shit.

124
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:55,027
He's gonna bail any moment.

125
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:02,167
-Jump out!
-Bail-out on Druid Hill, 700 Block...

126
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:05,333
suspect wearing gray sweats,
running into the court.

127
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:08,141
Fuck me.

128
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,312
Close shop. Police.

129
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:18,615
-C'mon, shorty. Step.
-He ain't man enough for you.

130
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,379
Re-up!

131
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,651
Hello, Officer.

132
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,216
Run, man!

133
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,626
-Move, motherfucker.
-White man walking!

134
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:30,325
Yo, move, shorty, that's my re-up, yo!

135
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,464
-Goddamn.
-He's coming back!

136
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,133
-Give it up, son!
-Cut him off, cut him off!

137
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,604
Yo, get him!

138
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:43,210
-I got the bag!
-He's going right.

139
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,050
-Get the bag.
-Yo, move, man!

140
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:50,915
What's up?

141
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,583
Damn, motherfucker.

142
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,385
Bet you don't do that shit to a white man.

143
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:02,056
Y'all get the fuck away from him.
That man ain't did nothing to nobody.

144
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:05,264
Four packs. Street-ready.

145
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,935
-1 2-08.
-12-08.

146
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:12,507
Need a wagon inside the 800 block of Lex...

147
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:16,203
-inside the court.
-10-4, 12-08.

148
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:19,979
Anyone got a smoke?

149
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,050
How are you sitting with your bosses?

150
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,492
Rawls tried to close
this thing down last week.

151
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:35,030
Blow the wiretap by charging
some weak-sister murders.

152
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:37,692
-What stopped him?
-Daniels.

153
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,662
-Daniels?
-I couldn't believe it either.

154
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:43,638
I'm ready to throw in the fucking towel,
Daniels stepped up.

155
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:46,868
Yeah? Why didn't you come to me?

156
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,507
You don't trust me no more, Jimmy?

157
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:54,641
Who dropped a dime to that
newspaper reporter, Your Honor?

158
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:56,049
Where you been?

159
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:00,350
35 cents these days,
before anybody'll cough up a dial tone.

160
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,388
No, it's 50.

161
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:06,620
I got another week
before my homicide shift flips to night work.

162
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,062
I'm not back with them,
Rawls sticks it to me.

163
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,001
You got a friend here.

164
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,597
Worse comes to worse,
Pearlman goes to her bosses.

165
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,734
The State's Attorney's office
still has some love for you, Jimmy.

166
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:24,007
I'm starting to worry more
about the people who claim to love me...

167
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:25,513
than the ones who don't.

168
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,044
Now?

169
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,114
Yeah.

170
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:10,489
Somebody's hitting Stringer Bell's pager
from the Number 2 payphone...

171
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:11,495
in the Tower Court.

172
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,027
-Now?
-Now.

173
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:29,704
What's up?

174
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:01,642
-Freamon.
-Visual on Stinkum.

175
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,879
-Yo, we lost four to 5-0.
-What?

176
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,475
-We lost four.
-Yo, why the fuck are you telling me this?

177
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:10,151
I'll talk to you later.

178
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,903
Does he think I can
just pull it out of my ass?

179
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:44,947
Can't go outside and play till
your homework's done?

180
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:47,785
Can't do shit till I clear this case for Rawls.

181
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:49,458
How old is it?

182
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,160
Old and cold.

183
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:53,620
Yours to begin with?

184
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:59,233
Then, my friend, you are double-fucked.

185
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:05,066
Motherfucker.

186
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,872
Son of a bitch!

187
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,343
Give me the card.

188
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:21,790
-You sick, heartless bastard.
-Come on, give me the card.

189
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,934
She was a gypsy woman

190
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,666
She was a gypsy woman

191
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,651
-Madame Laurie?
-You scoff?

192
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:54,786
Madame fucking LaRue, Jay?

193
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,984
Better men than you have
turned to this lady...

194
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:59,324
in their dark night of dead ends.

195
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,923
You're not serious.

196
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,763
I don't joke
when it comes to Madame LaRue.

197
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:09,065
The woman, she has an unexplainable gift...

198
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:11,504
in matters of death investigation.

199
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,005
She transcends the rational.

200
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,077
Give her a call.

201
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:39,532
He's dropped here,
so the dumpsters cover it from this side.

202
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:43,204
But everyone over there
with a window had a view.

203
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,244
Merit badge for two good little Scouts.

204
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:01,251
Ma'am, you need some help with that?

205
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:06,758
-I'm all right.
-Please, it's our pleasure.

206
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:17,231
Let me understand.

207
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:21,034
Y'all hang around the projects,
white and black together...

208
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:24,714
ties and jackets on, looking to help ladies
with their shopping carts...

209
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:25,941
and whatever else.

210
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,652
Police, right?

211
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,287
Afraid so, Ma'am.

212
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:33,913
About the murder a while back, right?

213
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:35,616
Maintenance man?

214
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:48,833
The defendants can take a seat.

215
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,232
-The judge will be in shortly.
-Can I take the file?

216
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:55,877
-Here.
-Thank you.

217
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,746
Excuse me, Ma'am?

218
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,135
-Detective?
-I need to pull one out.

219
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:21,704
Yeah, which one?

220
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:32,613
Let's see. Dope, coke, dope, theft, dope...

221
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:35,150
Ioitering, coke, attempted theft, dope...

222
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:38,551
dope, theft, dope,
and the charge du jour is...

223
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,881
possession, to wit, cocaine.

224
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:44,119
-But you need him?
-I need him.

225
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:46,955
Okay, he bounces over to drug court...

226
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:49,497
pleads to possession
and agrees to probation...

227
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,827
with ongoing treatment.

228
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:52,902
-That's it?
-That's it.

229
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:54,627
Okay.

230
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,638
I'm with your boy Bubs.

231
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:03,245
-You want out, right?
-Yeah.

232
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,382
Plead guilty to possession
and convince the drug court judge...

233
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:08,110
you want to get your shit clean.

234
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,743
-Drug court?
-Shake it off in treatment...

235
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:13,345
go to some meetings
and pee when they tell you to pee.

236
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,424
-No jail?
-No jail.

237
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,991
-I'm out right now?
-Soon as you're processed.

238
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,024
Okay.

239
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,376
Dead man was coming this way
and another man was walking behind him.

240
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:43,415
Must've said something to him, because he
turned around before he got shot.

241
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,286
-Do you know the man who did it?
-No, sir.

242
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:48,080
-What'd he look like?
-Who?

243
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:51,724
-The bad guy.
-Light skin, medium height.

244
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:54,929
Didn't have no meat on him.

245
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:57,599
-Young or old?
-He wasn't young.

246
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,335
Okay, if you pretend
my partner here is the victim...

247
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:03,531
and I'm the guy with the gun....

248
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:08,476
-This close?
-No.

249
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:17,677
Like that?

250
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:21,714
Yeah, that's about right.

251
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:28,054
-Do you think, if you saw this guy again--
-I didn't....

252
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,597
Ma'am, please, don't be afraid.

253
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,860
From where I was sitting,
his back was to me.

254
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,334
It's all right, you done good.

255
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,068
You have any trouble at all, you call us.

256
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:53,852
-She can't make a positive ID.
-My man Omar can.

257
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:57,256
A stickup artist with a half-dozen priors.
That's your eyeball witness?

258
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,761
She corroborates him on the details,
right down to the close-range shot.

259
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:03,731
We've also got Omar saying
if we jack Bird, we'll get the gun.

260
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,425
Says he's too stupid to throw it off.

261
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:08,868
So, between her and Omar,
a match on the gun gets us over.

262
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,367
It happened like you said...

263
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,904
Iike it was a plan.

264
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:16,501
It was a plan.

265
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,383
What's your address?

266
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:29,023
734 Fayette.

267
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:31,786
734 Fayette.

268
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,758
What's the apartment?

269
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,895
Kid, what apartment?

270
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,900
Come on, kid, what's the apartment?

271
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:47,432
-1 1-M.
-Okay, 1 1-M. Is that so hard?

272
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:49,903
What's your DOB?

273
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,180
Come on, kid.

274
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:56,109
What?

275
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:58,115
It's him.

276
00:21:58,722 --> 00:21:59,848
Who?

277
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:25,911
Kevin Johnson?

278
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:31,384
You hungry? Ham and cheese? Tuna?

279
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:35,783
I want a Reese's, yo. Peanut butter cup.

280
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:38,720
Drink?

281
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:40,529
Tea in a can.

282
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:42,789
You got it.

283
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:47,292
Go down to the machines.

284
00:22:47,937 --> 00:22:50,462
Get a peanut butter cup
and a can of Lipton's tea.

285
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,286
Motherfucker can't even look at me.

286
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:08,486
-What say we start over on this?
-Start over?

287
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:11,185
My lawyer said I got a case
against y'all for this shit.

288
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:14,752
Fuck the lawyers.
I'm trying to talk about life here, Kevin.

289
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:21,499
Game already cost you, right?
More than it should have, I know.

290
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,002
Whose fault is that?

291
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,202
His. Ours.

292
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:29,736
Mine, maybe.

293
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:33,781
Thing is, I feel like
I owe you something here.

294
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:37,410
So, I'm asking how you want to carry this.
You want to get out?

295
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:41,916
You want to do something else
with the rest of your years?

296
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:43,390
You come see me.

297
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:49,128
Tea was sold out.

298
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,729
Might be tomorrow, might not be for a while.

299
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,865
But when you're ready for
something different, give me a call.

300
00:23:58,975 --> 00:24:00,340
I'll remember.

301
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:05,548
Motherfucker thinking he can
pimp me over a candy bar.

302
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:18,254
I'm thinking it might be a drug thing,
or maybe straight-up robbery.

303
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:22,830
-You're lrish, no?
-Italian.

304
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,227
-Santangelo?
-Santangelo.

305
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,367
Saint Angelo.

306
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:31,838
Early martyr, patron saint of Licata, ltaly.

307
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:34,806
Prayed for his killer
with the knife still in him.

308
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:37,641
But it's not Saint Angelo calling.

309
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,913
It's Saint Anthony who wants to help you.

310
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:42,511
He does?

311
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,251
Very much.

312
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,723
Ain't he the guy you call
when you lose something?

313
00:25:06,743 --> 00:25:08,176
You sure that's Anthony?

314
00:25:08,478 --> 00:25:11,379
Go to the victim's grave, bury the statue...

315
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:15,175
wait an hour, a full hour, no shortcuts.

316
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:18,282
Then dig it up. Go straight home.

317
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:22,052
When you go to bed, hold it to your ear.

318
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,787
And he tells me who did it?

319
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:37,530
I think it was my turn to pick.

320
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:41,940
Yeah, definitely my turn. You had me
down at the B&O the other night.

321
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:44,603
After you dragged me
to the Sugar Hill Tavern, remember?

322
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:45,703
No.

323
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:48,407
Hey, Turk.

324
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:01,026
Where's Nadine this fine evening?

325
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:06,229
Gainesville. Been down in Florida
at her sister's all damn week.

326
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:15,371
Shame to say, though. Lack of pussy
will change even a good man's demeanor.

327
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:19,639
Sweet as can be.

328
00:26:36,532 --> 00:26:37,499
Marla.

329
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,000
Good to see you.
You remember my husband, Cedric?

330
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:42,663
Yes, I do. Nice to see you.

331
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,107
Marla's with me on the GBC's
downtown redevelopment committee.

332
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,542
She's the one that prods me
awake at the meetings.

333
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:53,082
That was drastic stuff.
Everybody was nodding off.

334
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:55,810
-That last one was so long--
-Excuse me.

335
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:04,250
I think it's the best ticket in years.

336
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:14,526
$500-a-plate fundraisers
for a police lieutenant?

337
00:27:15,371 --> 00:27:19,398
Even in this city, that constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment.

338
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:23,673
And which member of the ticket
has so energized you?

339
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:27,007
The Mayor? Council President?

340
00:27:27,483 --> 00:27:31,852
-The Registrar of Wills, maybe?
-The Mayor, I might recognize if I saw him.

341
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:34,984
For the rest,
I'd pretty much need B of I photos.

342
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:36,490
You're not wrong, Lieutenant.

343
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:40,926
In this state,
it's a thin line between campaign posters...

344
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,691
and photo arrays.

345
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,167
Pop quiz.

346
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,771
City council? Eastside, maybe?

347
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:03,743
State senator.
Clay Davis, from the 39th District.

348
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,545
Vice-chair on the budget committee.

349
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:09,783
You'll never make Major at this rate.

350
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,858
Excuse me, while I do my duty
and kiss some senatorial haunches.

351
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:25,698
Clay, nice to see you again.

352
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,509
Come on, let's roll.

353
00:28:45,194 --> 00:28:46,627
Ain't you gonna sign it?

354
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:49,562
No, you get that back
when the meeting's over.

355
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:51,700
And if you don't stay, we don't sign.

356
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:54,334
That's how it works.

357
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:02,738
Come on, I want to see the show.

358
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,608
Bubbs.

359
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,351
10: We continue to take personal inventory...

360
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:13,047
and when we are wrong, promptly admit it.

361
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:15,987
1 1 : We sought through
prayer and meditation...

362
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:20,051
to improve our conscious contact with God,
as we understood Him....

363
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:24,727
I ain't seen some of these faces in so long,
thought they were dead.

364
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,558
Same thing, ain't it?

365
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:29,832
Having had a spiritual awakening
as the result of these steps...

366
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:32,464
we try to carry
this message to other addicts...

367
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:35,009
and practice these principles
in all our affairs.

368
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:38,307
Today's speaker is going to be Waylon...

369
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:41,042
who, if you come to these meetings,
you have to know.

370
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,225
Hell, you all know I'm Waylon,
and I'm an addict.

371
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:51,725
Hi, Waylon.

372
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:56,265
And the fact is that I want to be clean today
more than I want to be high.

373
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,331
I know that's right.

374
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:02,869
It's good to be here.
Hell, it's good to be anywhere clean.

375
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,231
Even Baltimore.

376
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,370
I been clean a few 24 hours now,
and I'm still dead certain...

377
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,607
that my disease wants me dead.

378
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:18,082
Yeah, I'm in here with you all, talking shit
about how strong I am, how strong I feel...

379
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:22,283
but my disease is out there in that
parking lot, doing push-ups on steroids...

380
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:25,827
waiting for the chance to kick my ass
up and down the street again.

381
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:29,593
Scars on my hands, on my feet...

382
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,324
two bouts of endocarditis...

383
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:37,729
Hep C and whatnot knocking down walls
and kicking out windows in my liver.

384
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,234
I lost a good wife...

385
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:45,512
bad girlfriend, and the respect of anyone...

386
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:48,413
that ever tried to loan me money
or do me a favor.

387
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:52,483
Pawned my pickup, my bike...

388
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:55,523
my National Steel guitar...

389
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:58,854
and a stamp collection
that my granddad left me.

390
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:02,192
And when it was almost over for me...

391
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,466
and I was out there on them corners...

392
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:07,832
not a pot to piss in,
and anyone that ever knew me or loved me...

393
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:10,462
cussing my name,
you know what I told myself?

394
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,470
I said, "Waylon, you're doing good."

395
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:16,805
I surely did.

396
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:19,204
I thought I was God's own drug addict.

397
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:21,749
And if God hadn't meant
for me to get high...

398
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:24,843
he wouldn't have made
being high so much, like, perfect.

399
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,682
Now, I know I got one more high left in me...

400
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:31,817
but I doubt very seriously
if I have one more recovery.

401
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:36,855
So if there's anybody out there
that sees that bottom coming up at them...

402
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,325
I'm here to talk sense.

403
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:42,166
I don't care who you are...

404
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:43,903
what you done...

405
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,732
or who you done it to.

406
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:47,373
If you're here...

407
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,777
so am l.

408
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:50,639
That's right.

409
00:31:56,953 --> 00:31:59,217
The Mustard Seed Group
gives out key chains...

410
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:01,119
for stretches of clean time.

411
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,884
So if you've earned it,
come on up and get it.

412
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:06,827
Does anybody have nine months?

413
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,992
Does anybody have six months?

414
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,531
-Does anybody have three months?
-Yeah.

415
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,444
Does anybody have one month?

416
00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:37,952
And now, for the most
important person in this room...

417
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,153
does anybody have 24 hours...

418
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,260
or a sincere desire to live?

419
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:43,729
Yeah, all right.

420
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,185
We shoved off this morning.

421
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,353
"God grant me the strength...

422
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:17,023
"to accept the things I cannot change...

423
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,533
"and the courage
to change the things I can...

424
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:22,001
"and the wisdom to know the difference."

425
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:30,743
What's the score?

426
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:34,074
Orioles, 4 to 3.
Bernie Williams just doubled, though.

427
00:33:34,183 --> 00:33:36,674
They always let the Yankees
back into it, always.

428
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:38,845
No, they got a bullpen this year.

429
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:42,721
-Who's pitching?
-Buddy Groom.

430
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:46,094
Who you driving for?

431
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,757
Marla Daniels.

432
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,535
I'd love to crack this here crib.

433
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:56,104
Yeah?

434
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:58,605
Good day's work. Good day's work.

435
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:01,267
What about the alarm system?

436
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:03,868
Shit, I'd wire that weak-ass
thing back on itself...

437
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:06,812
pull the truck up,
bust through those French doors.

438
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,909
-That'd work.
-Yes, indeed.

439
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,187
Sell most of this good shit around the way...

440
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:16,224
but some of it, like the art and all,
I might have to run it up New York.

441
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:17,792
Name's Damien Price.

442
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,852
But I mostly go by Day-Day.

443
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:21,324
I'm Cedric Daniels.

444
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:25,267
But I mostly go by Lieutenant.

445
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:31,164
Look, they're bringing in Roberts.

446
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:34,003
There you are.

447
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:36,738
There's somebody I need you to meet.

448
00:34:50,226 --> 00:34:51,693
-Go on.
-Yeah.

449
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:54,556
-Take it all off.
-Rub them together like that.

450
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,690
See here, motherfucker.

451
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,125
You got to put this Gant thing on Bird...

452
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:02,636
and you got to do something
with that other case...

453
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:03,705
the young girl.

454
00:35:03,806 --> 00:35:05,068
Diedre Kresson.

455
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:08,166
You need to be able to
charge both them murders...

456
00:35:08,277 --> 00:35:10,438
and then you walk that on up to Rawls.

457
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:12,104
Now, you see, Jimmy...

458
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:15,608
here's the hard part,
for an asshole like yourself:

459
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:19,677
You just got to give him
them clearances like a goddamn gift.

460
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:22,415
And then you still might have
to kiss his ass...

461
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:24,925
for about three, four motherfucking months.

462
00:35:25,027 --> 00:35:26,688
You're gonna have to do it.

463
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,320
Three or four months?

464
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,161
Got to, Jimmy.

465
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:37,996
Too fucking late to do anything else.
You gonna be one ass-kissing white man.

466
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:42,141
You know why I respect you
so much, Bunk?

467
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:47,141
It's not 'cause you're good police.

468
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:49,613
'Cause, you know, fuck that, right?

469
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:51,278
Fuck that, yeah.

470
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:55,847
It's not 'cause when I came to Homicide,
you taught me all kinds cool shit about....

471
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:58,818
I don't know, whatever.

472
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:00,217
Whatever.

473
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:04,964
It's 'cause when it came time
for you to fuck me...

474
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:09,164
you were very gentle.

475
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:11,267
Damn right.

476
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:15,209
See, 'cause you could've
hauled me out of the garage...

477
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:18,178
and just bent me
over the hood of a radio car.

478
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:23,246
But no, you were very gentle.

479
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:28,155
I knew it was your first time.

480
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:31,452
I wanted to make that shit special.

481
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:33,354
It was, man.

482
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:35,959
It fucking was.

483
00:36:41,937 --> 00:36:44,337
-Take your fucking money back.
-No, this is mine.

484
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,237
Take it back, you old whore.

485
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:48,365
Turk.

486
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,312
Can I get one more?

487
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,318
What's up?

488
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:08,296
-They up there, right?
-Yeah, they up there.

489
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:09,987
Hey, Dee.

490
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,462
You get a chance, man,
let me pull your coat to something.

491
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,165
I got a little move we might could do.
So get with me after, okay?

492
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:19,841
All right. Most def.

493
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:25,542
The only reason why I even called Bell
was because these niggers--

494
00:37:25,648 --> 00:37:29,140
You're not supposed to talk shit
on the phone and you know that.

495
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:36,686
What's up, bro?

496
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,791
Who's snitching?

497
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:45,365
-Nobody.
-Is you sure on that, man?

498
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:48,025
You done had the stick-up,
then the jump-out.

499
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:50,765
-Now, they running up on Stink.
-My crew, we tight.

500
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,098
All right?

501
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:54,835
Ain't nobody holding no extra money.
I checked all that.

502
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:58,345
Maybe your ass just ran a stop
or had a taillight out or some shit like--

503
00:37:58,447 --> 00:38:00,278
You think I'd run a stop with $40,000?

504
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:02,043
-Fuck no.
-Nigger, I don't know.

505
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:03,482
Something is up.

506
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,681
So go down there today...

507
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:09,257
tell them hoppers you got
working for you down there...

508
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:11,383
that this shit is about to change.

509
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:14,724
Stringer gonna come down there,
he gonna run through the changes.

510
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,424
Until this shit is straight, the Pit is dead.

511
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,145
Thing is, why they didn't pop Stink?

512
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:36,550
Knockos took the boy and the package,
and they got Stink by the tags on the truck.

513
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:39,777
You took that down to the police
and filed a report, right?

514
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:42,982
Truck, I ditched that shit
up off Cold Spring Lane, man.

515
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:46,559
You ain't heard nothing
from the knockos yet, right?

516
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,622
-No.
-What the fuck?

517
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:55,128
They catch four packs
popping out the truck.

518
00:38:55,237 --> 00:38:57,137
They don't even get the plate?

519
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:01,332
What's all this shit?

520
00:39:02,044 --> 00:39:03,511
Something's up, man.

521
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:05,742
Something is definitely up.

522
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:14,244
I got somewhere I gotta be.
Cover me with Daniels, will you?

523
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:19,494
Asshole.

524
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:22,729
Herc, Carver.

525
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,689
-What?
-What?

526
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:26,859
Come here.

527
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:28,527
Come here.

528
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,676
Them two is freaks.

529
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:44,082
Stash-finding motherfuckers
popped the package from nowhere.

530
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:45,278
Who you talking?

531
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:48,754
Skinny black motherfucker
and that ass-ugly knocko.

532
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:50,887
The white boy with the ball cap.

533
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,655
-The ones who jumped Bodie?
-Batman and Robin.

534
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:55,988
All right?

535
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,367
-Bang.
-You got them, baby.

536
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,961
-I'm Batman.
-I don't think so.

537
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:06,667
-Batman's white.
-And Robin's black?

538
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,712
You heard the hopper,
you're the ass-ugly white guy.

539
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:19,287
Boy Wonder,
why don't you suck my bat-dick?

540
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:21,349
Get the fuck outta here.

541
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:29,320
Why don't you sign this for me there,
Mr. One-day Man?

542
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:37,169
God have mercy when they piss you, boy.

543
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,270
You mean the god of my understanding?

544
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:43,878
No, we gotta get you
some clean piss, you know...

545
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:46,471
so you can take up
into your probation office.

546
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:47,810
Yo, Bubs.

547
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,146
Who the fuck do we know with clean piss?

548
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:04,730
-So you're ready to charge this one?
-If we luck into the gun, yeah.

549
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,795
And then we tag-team Bird.

550
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:09,097
If we get him with the gun,
we take it federal.

551
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:11,798
Five years minimum,
and he's got prior felonies...

552
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:12,874
it's a lot more.

553
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:15,034
We got an address we want to hit?

554
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:19,707
We're working with informants.
As soon as we get something, we jump.

555
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:23,375
...warm air for the afternoon...

556
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:26,318
partly sunny, windy and warm
with a chance of thunderstorms...

557
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:30,323
high up to 83, and then on Friday,
clearing and windy with a high near 70.

558
00:41:30,425 --> 00:41:33,588
Weather updated around
the clock on WTOP radio.

559
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:36,560
I'm meteorologist Dave Lew
at the Weather Channel.

560
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:39,724
This is the WTOP radio network.

561
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,236
You worried about being seen?

562
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:48,506
If anybody got a problem
with me spending time with y'all...

563
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,773
I'd be much obliged to stick
my gun straight in their mouth.

564
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:53,776
How's that work?

565
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:01,185
Bird not up in the mix today.

566
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,090
If we had more than a street name,
maybe we could come up with an address.

567
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,725
What can I say? Out here, Bird just Bird.

568
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:12,363
So, what up,
you all fixing snatch him from out here?

569
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:13,456
That's the plan.

570
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:16,902
He don't pack down here, none of them do.
And that's the rule.

571
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:20,497
Now, if you want iron, you gotta go
to one of those kids up in the towers.

572
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:22,702
-We need the gun.
-Then y'all got a problem.

573
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:25,211
Without knowing his crib,
we definitely got a problem.

574
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:27,544
Not unless y'all know where Bird like to cop.

575
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:30,140
-What, Bird gets high?
-Not in the towers, he don't.

576
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:33,244
Avon ain't having his people using.
That's another rule.

577
00:42:33,355 --> 00:42:35,823
"Never get high on your own supply."

578
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,754
Now, if I was hunting Mr. Bird...

579
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:43,494
I would consider the best package
to be the red Dilly...

580
00:42:43,632 --> 00:42:45,293
that's over there in Carrollton.

581
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,267
That's if I have to be
constabulating like you all.

582
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,129
Carrollton?

583
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:54,273
I know one thing, when you all
run up on him, you all best be more...

584
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:55,840
careful, that is.

585
00:42:56,245 --> 00:42:57,212
Why is that?

586
00:42:57,312 --> 00:43:00,008
Bird will throw down
without thinking, for sure.

587
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,957
Poot.

588
00:43:10,392 --> 00:43:12,155
Where Wallace been at, man?

589
00:43:12,494 --> 00:43:13,688
I don't know.

590
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:17,226
He in the wind.

591
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:20,428
Wallace been fucked up.

592
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:25,395
Since they got that stickup boy, you know?
Put him on the car like that.

593
00:43:26,308 --> 00:43:28,105
Wallace all quiet and shit.

594
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,142
Don't even come out his room some days.

595
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:37,784
I'm looking for Dee. You seen him?

596
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,727
Dee.

597
00:43:46,361 --> 00:43:47,350
Chilling?

598
00:43:48,163 --> 00:43:49,221
What's up?

599
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:54,098
-What're you doing down in the projects?
-I got something, man.

600
00:43:55,003 --> 00:43:56,334
Something right.

601
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,134
Come on over.

602
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:03,842
Where the shop at?

603
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,308
Nothing today.

604
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:10,779
See, that's the thing,
'cause if you need more of that...

605
00:44:10,886 --> 00:44:12,319
I got this connect.

606
00:44:13,722 --> 00:44:14,711
Yeah?

607
00:44:14,823 --> 00:44:16,950
This guy I know from the club, he from D.C.

608
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:20,358
He got this thing through New Orleans,
these Jamaicans down there.

609
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:21,588
New Orleans?

610
00:44:23,231 --> 00:44:24,926
They're offering weight, Dee.

611
00:44:28,503 --> 00:44:30,733
-My uncle know about it?
-No, see.

612
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,931
This thing on the side for me...

613
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:36,675
I got enough to turn
a New York quarter on it...

614
00:44:36,778 --> 00:44:39,975
but I don't have what you got right here
with the distribution.

615
00:44:40,082 --> 00:44:41,743
You see what I'm saying?

616
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:47,752
I'm saying, Dee,
I'd be taking all the risk with them peoples.

617
00:44:47,856 --> 00:44:51,656
Once I have the package, I bring it
down here to you, and you put it out.

618
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,092
We do an even split on what comes back.

619
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:56,353
Right?

620
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:00,194
Let me think on that, all right?

621
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:03,567
Finally get some ends for us.
You see what I'm saying?

622
00:45:03,905 --> 00:45:04,894
Yeah.

623
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,235
Yeah, most def.

624
00:45:09,978 --> 00:45:11,104
I'm out.

625
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:14,274
-Be good.
-Think on that.

626
00:46:10,672 --> 00:46:10,872
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.

627
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:13,067
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.

628
00:46:13,975 --> 00:46:17,308
$5, yeah. Everybody, $5 hats right here.

629
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,138
Which door are we watching again?

630
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:23,181
The vacant next to the store.

631
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:25,447
That's the shooting gallery.

632
00:46:25,554 --> 00:46:26,919
Is he still in there?

633
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:30,355
Greggs is on the back
and we're on the front, so you tell me.

634
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:39,491
Yeah.

635
00:46:58,854 --> 00:47:03,018
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.
I got you right here.

636
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:06,588
Cover up that head of yours.
You know what I mean?

637
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,622
Can't beat that, right?

638
00:47:11,266 --> 00:47:13,734
$5 hats, right here. $5 hats.

639
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:20,106
-$5 hat there, mister.
-Fuck you, man.

640
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:27,439
Take them.

641
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:29,116
Shorty.

642
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:32,953
Get your hands back.

643
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:38,153
I got him.

644
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,591
Get off me, man.

645
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:42,629
Get the fuck off me.

646
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:44,527
-I got the feet.
-Bitch-ass cops!

647
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,035
There we go.

648
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:55,540
Yeah, look what we have here.

649
00:47:58,446 --> 00:47:59,435
Baby.

650
00:47:59,748 --> 00:48:01,215
Get the fuck off me.

651
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:04,307
My hand.

652
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:07,021
-Fucking bitch.
-Shut the fuck up!

653
00:48:08,323 --> 00:48:09,756
Shit is tight, man.

654
00:48:14,696 --> 00:48:16,789
We should leave the couch
right there, right?

655
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:20,425
-Yeah, leave that shit right there.
-That's nice, that's straight.

656
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:28,731
So?

657
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:31,138
What's the deal, String?

658
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:35,713
-How often you all changing the stash?
-Every night since we got jacked.

659
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:39,446
-Anybody on the team getting high?
-No, man. Just the old touts.

660
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:42,213
And they ain't handling no money, no vials.

661
00:48:42,324 --> 00:48:44,383
You all been going in and out
of the vacants?

662
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:47,086
Making sure them narcos
don't set up in there?

663
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,217
Yeah, for sure.

664
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:51,458
I got no cell phones,
no house phones neither, right?

665
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:56,060
No, man, nothing but these pagers
and them pay boxes over there, that's it.

666
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:04,776
All right, tear them motherfuckers out.

667
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:06,336
What?

668
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:09,606
Tear out them phones.

669
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:13,385
From now on, you all need a payphone,
you walk a few blocks...

670
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:16,048
and you do not use
the same phone more than once a day.

671
00:49:16,157 --> 00:49:17,283
You hear me?

672
00:49:18,493 --> 00:49:20,188
-You hear me, right?
-Done.

673
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:23,793
-All right. Bey, tear them motherfuckers out.
-Come on, man.

674
00:49:35,377 --> 00:49:38,073
Man, come on. Get off the phone.

675
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:04,664
So, we wanted to hang...

676
00:50:05,006 --> 00:50:06,803
the velvet backdrop...

677
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:09,876
with the Lexus and the pit bulls...

678
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:12,977
but it's still out at the dry cleaners.

679
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:18,511
But seriously, folks,
we really wanted to show all the jurors...

680
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,579
that you left our little interrogation here
without any more scuff marks...

681
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,386
than what you brought in.

682
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,627
Fuck you, fat man.

683
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,354
"Fuck you, fat man."

684
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:33,199
I thought we were friends.

685
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:44,407
That gun is downstairs now,
in the ballistics lab.

686
00:50:44,746 --> 00:50:48,682
It comes back on a dead state's witness,
then you're gonna see death row.

687
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,913
-You up for that?
-Suck my dick, dyke cunt.

688
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:55,212
Where's my lawyer at?

689
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,688
Freak. Cunt-eater.

690
00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:02,855
You got one chance,
you stupid motherfucker.

691
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:06,129
You roll back on the people
you killed William Gant for...

692
00:51:06,234 --> 00:51:08,225
or you gonna eat the whole meal.

693
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,498
Tell you what...

694
00:51:11,072 --> 00:51:14,667
gimme this hand back and step to me,
and I'll fuck you in all three holes.

695
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:16,471
Fucking charmer, this one.

696
00:51:18,713 --> 00:51:19,702
Bitch.

697
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:22,309
You ain't got shit on me.

698
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:25,275
-One of you should go in.
-Is she in trouble?

699
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:28,048
Kima? He keeps this up, she'll cut his ass.

700
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:29,415
You ain't shit!

701
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:31,985
You ain't got shit on me!

702
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:38,556
So, you're my eyeball witness?

703
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:42,301
So, why'd you step up on this?

704
00:51:43,238 --> 00:51:47,436
Bird trifling, basically.
He killed an everyday working man and all.

705
00:51:48,476 --> 00:51:50,444
Don't get it twisted, I do some dirt, too...

706
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:53,912
but I ain't never put my gun
on nobody who wasn't in the game.

707
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:56,414
A man must have a code.

708
00:51:57,752 --> 00:51:58,912
No doubt.

709
00:52:05,994 --> 00:52:08,724
-Man, I know you from somewhere.
-Yeah?

710
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,955
I was in Southwestern
before I came to Homicide.

711
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:13,590
Worked Frederick Road.

712
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:16,093
No, I mean, back in the day.

713
00:52:19,374 --> 00:52:21,137
You go to Edmondson, right?

714
00:52:22,577 --> 00:52:24,272
Yeah, you was ahead of me.

715
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:28,179
I remember you was the first brother
I ever seen play that sport with a stick.

716
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:29,910
What's it called?

717
00:52:30,418 --> 00:52:32,283
-Lacrosse, man.
-For sure.

718
00:52:33,555 --> 00:52:35,284
Yeah, I was All-Metro attack.

719
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:39,827
Prep school boys used to pee themselves
when they see old Bunk coming at them.

720
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:46,361
So look here, homey.

721
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:51,963
Seeing as how you're being all charitable
with your recollections...

722
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,874
what else you got in the way
of open murders?

723
00:52:54,976 --> 00:52:57,137
-Going to Barksdale?
-Going anywhere.

724
00:52:57,445 --> 00:53:00,573
-How far back do you want me to go?
-As far as you need.

725
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:02,749
Murder stay murder.

726
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:12,448
Thanks.

727
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:19,926
Gun matches.

728
00:53:21,135 --> 00:53:22,500
You're done, Bird.

729
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:26,097
Last chance to grab a little something
for yourself on a deal.

730
00:53:26,207 --> 00:53:28,937
Eat my shit first,
you downtown white whore.

731
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:40,353
Yeah, that's right.
Take this ugly-ass cunt-eater with you, too.

732
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:55,736
Yo, I'm cuffed, man.

733
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:02,206
You gonna at least give me
a fair chance, right?

734
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,676
Come on, man. Don't do me like that, man.

735
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,544
You fat fuck!

736
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:13,987
Take these handcuffs off, man!

737
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:18,888
Fulton and Baker, you say?

738
00:54:20,495 --> 00:54:23,089
It happened last year,
couple days after Easter.

739
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:27,133
This girl by the name of Neecee.
She about 30, 35.

740
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:28,830
Denise Redding.

741
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:31,233
Yeah, I got it.

742
00:54:33,374 --> 00:54:34,602
I'll be damned.

743
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:40,738
Bird sure know how to bring it
out in people, don't he?

744
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:47,677
Hello?

745
00:54:53,294 --> 00:54:54,955
The Lindsey case, right?

746
00:54:57,398 --> 00:55:00,060
No, Lindsey. Martin Lindsey.

747
00:55:06,074 --> 00:55:08,042
Who the fuck is Denise Redding?

748
00:55:22,056 --> 00:55:25,287
-What the fuck did you do to him?
-Here's yours, Mike.

749
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,639
I don't even fucking remember this one.
I swear I don't.

750
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,798
Well, it's down.

751
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:44,736
Our boy gave us a statement,
two witnesses and an ID of your shooter.

752
00:55:45,747 --> 00:55:47,612
Take it with our compliments.

753
00:55:49,117 --> 00:55:50,243
Sanny.

754
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:52,918
What are you doing downtown
this time of night?

755
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,148
Madame fucking LaRue?

756
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:59,021
I gotta thank you, Jaybird,
you saved my fucking life here.

757
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:03,154
Only thing I can't figure is I asked
for help on the Lindsey case, not this one.

758
00:56:03,264 --> 00:56:04,253
Mike...

759
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,633
fuck the gypsy shit.

760
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:10,635
These are the guys that
saved your ass, right here.

761
00:56:15,643 --> 00:56:16,610
Thanks.

762
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:21,537
Jimmy.

763
00:56:25,053 --> 00:56:26,486
We gotta talk, man.

764
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:29,920
It's about Rawls.

765
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:13,189
What's the plan here?

766
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:15,931
Drunken fuck on a Tuesday night?

767
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,396
-Is it Wednesday morning?
-I'm not drunk.

768
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:24,736
It's Rawls.

769
00:57:26,147 --> 00:57:27,842
He's going after my badge.

770
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:32,308
What?

771
00:57:33,054 --> 00:57:34,851
They're gonna do me, Ronnie.

772
00:57:37,425 --> 00:57:38,585
They're gonna do me.

773
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:41,457
I love this fucking job,
and they're gonna do me.

774
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,398
Come on.

775
00:57:51,398 --> 00:58:01,398
