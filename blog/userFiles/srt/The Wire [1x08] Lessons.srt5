1
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,774
Number 18.

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,076
Conine.

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,614
I knew that one.

4
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,583
All right, this one's for Mikey.

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,984
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, one lemonade, please.

6
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,483
You ready?

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,648
Number 6.

8
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:28,386
I know it.

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:32,287
-David Segui?
-Melvin Mora, numbnuts.

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,229
I thought Mora was number 9.

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,235
Guys, we're gonna play that spy game.
Remember the spy game?

12
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:39,531
-Yeah.
-Who's it?

13
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,698
That tall black guy over there.

14
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,000
You're supposed to say
African-American, Dad.

15
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,442
African-American, then.

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,538
-I'm the front, you're the follow.
-I was the follow last time.

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,480
Don't argue, go on. Go.

18
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,147
Come on!

19
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,956
I got him.

20
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:04,209
Yeah, they're both brown hair, one that big,
the other about that big...

21
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:08,185
and he's wearing, I don't know
what the fuck he's wearing. He's....

22
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,449
Will Michael and Sean McNulty
please report to the offices...

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,993
at the rear of the market.

24
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,960
Michael and Sean McNulty.

25
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,255
Please report.

26
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,526
One pay phone goes down, don't mean shit.

27
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,159
Both at the same time, that's a plan.

28
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,739
-We spooked them.
-Busting the runner?

29
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,967
Maybe it's that, maybe it's something else.

30
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,941
We still got the tower phones.

31
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,478
And we're up
on Stringer Bell's pager now, too.

32
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,447
Yeah, but this shows
just how cautious these guys are.

33
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,383
We make any play,
and they're ready to change up on us.

34
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,353
If they're not using
the pay phones in the low-rises...

35
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,014
then what are they doing?

36
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,388
They're walking to another pay phone.

37
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,826
We might see more traffic
on the tower pay phones.

38
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,067
Sergeants' test's tomorrow, right?

39
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,128
4:00 in the afternoon.

40
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,237
You ain't gonna take it this time?

41
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,706
Sure, why not?

42
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,075
-You ain't gonna study?
-Sure I am.

43
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:53,074
You guys need to follow
some of the boys out of the Pit...

44
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,653
and see what they're using for pay phones.

45
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,421
Excuse me, is that a direct order?

46
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,548
I'm just saying--

47
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,218
If you wanna follow these assholes
from phone to phone...

48
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,852
why don't you do it yourself?

49
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,022
I'm in-office, remember?

50
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,099
-Right, they took your gun.
-For shooting your car.

51
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,067
No, that was before.

52
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,231
-That's right, that was something else.
-Right.

53
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,975
You believe this guy?
Like there are fucking stripes on his sleeve.

54
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,914
You guys need to get up
on those rooftops today.

55
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,647
See what these mopes are using for phones.

56
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,800
Come here, look at this shit.

57
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,173
What the fuck is that?

58
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,180
-Let me look at that shit.
-Bird told me that shit.

59
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,012
Fucking peter-puffer,
get the fuck out of here.

60
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,134
Mr. Omar, you want ends on this?

61
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,406
No, darling, I'm cool.

62
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,780
Nice shirt.

63
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,619
Yeah, fuck you.

64
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,783
It takes guts wearing a pink shirt
on the BPD Homicide unit.

65
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,383
Yes, it does.

66
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:47,192
Guts, or a familiarity
with alternative lifestyles.

67
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:51,528
-What are you chasing?
-Toyota Camry.

68
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,763
Whose?

69
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,696
It's listed to some woman
with a county address...

70
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,140
but Saturday, my man
Stringer Bell was using it.

71
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,939
You were working the weekend?

72
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,445
No, I'm down in the Northeast market
with the kids, right?

73
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,540
-Who should appear before me?
-Market day for String, too?

74
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,883
I know he makes me if I get too close,
so I tell Sean and Michael front-and-follow.

75
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,481
They're so good, I lose track of them,
scared the shit out of myself.

76
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:16,152
But they stay with him, spec the Camry...

77
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,730
and Sean, my flesh and blood, gets the tag.

78
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,696
Your kids know front-and-follow?

79
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,996
They fucking love it.
We play spy in the mall sometimes.

80
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,901
Anyhow, I got a Woodmore address
of a woman...

81
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,031
who lends her wheels to Stringer Bell.

82
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,611
-It's a start.
-The fucking family McNulty. Jesus.

83
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,107
What?

84
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,313
Wallace.

85
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,352
-What?
-Yo, Wallace.

86
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,223
-What?
-What's this about here?

87
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,525
This one here?

88
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:02,064
"A bus traveling on Central Avenue begins
its route by picking up eight passengers.

89
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:06,907
"Next, it picks up four more, and then an
additional two, while discharging one.

90
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:10,004
"At the next-to-last stop,
three passengers get off the bus...

91
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:14,609
"and another two get on. How many
passengers are on the bus at the last stop?"

92
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,855
Just do it in your head.

93
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,424
Yo, testers coming out today.

94
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,654
New package.

95
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,921
I might be down later.

96
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:27,632
Later?

97
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,361
Look, I'll catch you
around the way, all right?

98
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:35,137
Wallace, man, you can't just lay up in here.

99
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,970
-Seven, right?
-Dee been asking about shit.

100
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,409
-So what?
-I been telling him you sick...

101
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,208
but you know he won't let me carry that
too much longer.

102
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:46,011
Now, look, I be down later sometime.

103
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,282
-No, man, testers gonna be out.
-Look, man, fuck the testers, all right?

104
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,789
Fuck the testers, fuck Dee, fuck all that shit.

105
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:57,089
Just let me hold $10,
and I'll give it back to you by Friday.

106
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,029
How? Dee ain't gonna pay you
for not working.

107
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,464
Look, you gonna let me hold $10, or not?

108
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,299
Eight?

109
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,668
Damn, Sarah, look. Close your eyes.

110
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,371
You working a ground stash. 20 tall pinks.

111
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,643
Two fiends come up and ask for two each,
another one cops three.

112
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,844
Then Bodie hands you 10 more,
but a white guy rolls up in a car...

113
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,443
waves you down, and pays for eight.

114
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,112
How many vials you got left?

115
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,957
Fifteen.

116
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,755
How the fuck can you keep the count right,
but not do the book problem?

117
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,023
Count be wrong, they'll fuck you up.

118
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,066
-No, he coming to you.
-Today?

119
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,001
-Yeah.
-He in a rush or something?

120
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:43,370
No, we told him to do it like that.
He had his hand out last night...

121
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,705
and we told him first thing today.

122
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,780
-He ain't coming into the tower?
-No, not like that.

123
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,146
Just run 20 on down to him.
He gonna roll on his way, all right?

124
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,152
-Be there in, like, an hour, maybe.
-Who gonna know?

125
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,087
-Little Man, he know Day.
-All right.

126
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,156
That was Stringer Bell?

127
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,990
Calling tower pay phone number 1,
after taking a page 15 minutes ago.

128
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,688
-We know Little Man?
-Yeah.

129
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,028
Enforcer in the 221 building.

130
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,593
Okay, so he's rolling out of the 221
in about a half an hour or so...

131
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,537
with 20 whatevers to hand off
to someone named Day.

132
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,033
Product coming out of the towers.

133
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,576
We're usually trying to catch it going in.

134
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,910
Yeah, if you wanna catch them,
we're gonna have to hustle.

135
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,746
Wallace, man, he bugging.

136
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:31,349
-Where he be at?
-Nowhere.

137
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,948
He just lays around all day, you know?

138
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,651
Begged my ass off for sandwich money.

139
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,627
You worried about him?

140
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,995
I mean, shit ain't right, Dee.

141
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,199
You might consult with him some.

142
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,500
What the fuck, man? lf he don't wanna
be down here, that's on him.

143
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,939
I mean, ain't like nobody holding
no gun to his head or nothing.

144
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,307
Yeah, but he ain't about nothing else.

145
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,913
He up in his room and shit,
all the damn day.

146
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,642
He up in his room and shit,
all the damn day.

147
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:01,616
All right, tell Wallace to come see me.

148
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,778
All right.

149
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,752
Be right back.

150
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,679
It's been two hours.

151
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,584
What if Little Man ain't working
in the 221 today?

152
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,551
What if this Day guy don't come?

153
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,398
What if he came,
and we missed the pick-up?

154
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,367
Yo, Herc, what if your mother
and father never met?

155
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,676
-How's shop doing?
-Steady rolling.

156
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,439
All right, let's take a ride.

157
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,015
-Beef run.
-Beef run, where at?

158
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,382
Pulaski, baby, the good shit.

159
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,548
Get in the car, man.

160
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,830
Yo, Poot. You the man for an hour.

161
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,804
Shit, look at me.

162
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,163
-Kima.
-The Lincoln, we're on it.

163
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:09,809
Hang back. Let's see where he goes.

164
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,019
I don't understand that, never did.

165
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,529
Damn, Bey, how can you stand that shit
with all that hot shit on it?

166
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:31,331
Man, trick is not to give a fuck, boy.
I got this, you know me.

167
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:34,929
So what? My uncle's cut y'all loose today?

168
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,473
No, we're celebrating.

169
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,169
Stinkum got some points
for some fresh territory.

170
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,803
I heard about that.
How much is yours in the package?

171
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:42,902
20.

172
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,176
We gotta run off the niggers
that been down there.

173
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,811
Ain't no thing.
Bunch of off-brand niggers is all.

174
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:52,423
You keep running that pit the way you been,
you gonna see points, too.

175
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,618
Yeah, you know, shit, I'm here waiting.

176
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,596
It'll come, right, Stink?

177
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,722
Yeah, I been talking to Orlando, right?

178
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:03,892
He said he got this good
coke connect from New Orleans.

179
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:07,595
Orlando?

180
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:12,109
He want me to put what he can get
out into the court, a little extra on the side.

181
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,043
I don't know, Dee,
you better talk to your uncle about that.

182
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,012
-Yeah, definitely.
-Hear that?

183
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,243
Yeah, I'm gonna see what he say on it. Yeah.

184
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,615
But, you know, today is your day, man.

185
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,246
-Stink day.
-His night, too.

186
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,882
Yeah, man, we gonna
break out tonight, daddy.

187
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,359
Bring some of Orlando's good pussy
over there by Little Man's.

188
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,823
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

189
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,833
You up there? You up?

190
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,133
-Yeah, he up.
-You up.

191
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,369
Nigger, I'm up! You don't gotta ask twice.

192
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,780
-What's wrong?
-No.

193
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,251
He give a fuck now.

194
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,416
Water.

195
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,794
-Step out of the car, sir.
-What did I do?

196
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,696
Step out of the car.

197
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,703
Go around to my partner, here.

198
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,377
-Man, look, I'm already late.
-Put your hands on the roof, please, sir.

199
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,677
Sir, you were observed in one of the city's
designated drug-free, anti-loitering zones...

200
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,217
where a drug suspect
leaned into your vehicle...

201
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,616
handing you something.

202
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,711
And when we signaled for you to stop...

203
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:33,313
you leaned over
as if concealing something...

204
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,792
-beneath the passenger seat.
-Look, enough of this shit, now.

205
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,295
-Is there something beneath that seat, sir?
-No.

206
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,332
Then you don't mind if we look, right?

207
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,891
Fuck y'all. This is some bullshit.

208
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,576
-That's none of your business, all right?
-How about if I make it my business?

209
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,127
You rang?

210
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,602
-Who's he?
-Damien Lavell Price.

211
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,301
He takes $20,000 in cash
out of the 221 building.

212
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,036
Lester picked up the drop
from one of the tower phones.

213
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,578
We followed him up Reservoir Hill
till he spotted us.

214
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,274
-He's a legislative aide?
-Who paged me?

215
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,810
He's in your office.

216
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,915
We popped him with $20,000 in cash.

217
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,320
-What kind of PC?
-Right off the wire.

218
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,655
Stringer Bell to someone on a tower phone.

219
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,955
We thought we were gonna
come up with drugs.

220
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,792
Got money instead.

221
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,625
I know this guy.

222
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:30,638
Orioles won last night.
Bullpen stood up to Boston.

223
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,335
You get that money cracking cribs, or what?

224
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,008
I'd like to speak to my attorney.

225
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:47,984
He was driving for a politician
at this fundraiser I went to.

226
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,084
-Which one?
-Someone from Annapolis...

227
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,060
from the looks of his ID, anyway.

228
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,791
-What do we charge here?
-He say the money's his?

229
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,000
He doesn't say shit.

230
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,331
He doesn't say shit.

231
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,631
Keep the cash, write him a receipt.

232
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,708
He wants to put a claim in
to the city solicitor, he can.

233
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,333
But they're gonna ask him
where he got the pile.

234
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,010
The angel of death.

235
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,012
Who's that?

236
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,914
Major Reed, lID.

237
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,089
Lieutenant, a word.

238
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,669
What's up?

239
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,406
-How you doing?
-Me?

240
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,244
Yeah, you. Everything is good?

241
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,046
I'm all right.

242
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,952
I mean, you fixed for cash
or something, man?

243
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:55,392
'Cause if you need a little something...

244
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,292
really, the thing to do is just to ask for it.

245
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,831
That's all I do,
is put money in your pocket...

246
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,060
and make sure
you don't stray from the nest!

247
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,158
Sit down.

248
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:09,637
Listen, the last motherfucking thing I need
is for the clean name on my liquor license...

249
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,437
to be dirtied the fuck up by you.
You understand that?

250
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,876
Avon, come on, man.

251
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,221
Do your fucking job!

252
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,909
I checked with
the state Personnel Department.

253
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,982
He's on the payroll
of Senator Davis' district office...

254
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:52,606
for more than a year.

255
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,652
He did four years in Hagerstown
for daytime B and E.

256
00:20:56,921 --> 00:21:00,049
Before that, drug charges
and a PBJ on a check charge.

257
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,555
And now we catch him coming out
of the towers...

258
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,822
with $20,000 in manicured, banded money.

259
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,693
You brought him in here on what charge?

260
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,297
Civil forfeiture.

261
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:15,004
Until he tells us a legitimate source
for that money, we keep it.

262
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:17,868
So you have no criminal charge.

263
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,502
No, just the money.

264
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,745
Give it back.

265
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,111
-Sir?
-Give the man back his money.

266
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,753
Sir, we pulled this off the wire...

267
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,292
with one of our suspects telling
another to expect a pick-up.

268
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:40,421
-It's drug money in that car.
-Give him back his money.

269
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,996
Write it up as an unwarranted car stop.

270
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,531
Now I ask you to put a charge
on a drug dealer, Lieutenant.

271
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,006
That's all I ask.

272
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,609
And now I got wiretaps, pager clones,
affidavits coming out of my ass.

273
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,912
And you're in people's shit
where you're not supposed to be.

274
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,742
-Sir--
-I'm shutting this down, Lieutenant.

275
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,948
You charge what you can,
and you do it by the end of the week.

276
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,127
-We did nothing wrong here.
-You jacked up a senatorial aide.

277
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,227
You went into his pocket,
pulled out $20,000.

278
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:19,633
And though there's no criminal charge,
you think it wise to try to keep it.

279
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,838
You shit all over yourself...

280
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,068
all over me, all over this department.

281
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:30,879
Now, I told you, no surprises, remember?

282
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,790
$20,000, even.

283
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,420
Sign here, or you can
count it yourself, if you want.

284
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,526
So I can leave now?

285
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,974
Will somebody please tell me
what the fuck that was about?

286
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,784
This is bullshit.

287
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,685
We just gave back 20 large
of Barksdale's money.

288
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:21,659
Hey, what the fuck?

289
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,727
Let me guess, the Deputy?
How's he got onto this so quick?

290
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,528
-I told him.
-You told him?

291
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,334
Why would you be telling him?

292
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,739
He's the Deputy for Operations,
I arrested an aide to a state senator.

293
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,811
How do I not tell him?

294
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,972
Have you noticed there hasn't been
a complaint from the senator?

295
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,013
Know why?

296
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,677
What is his driver doing coming out
of the high-rises with so much money?

297
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,617
-I told the Deputy that.
-What did he say?

298
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,188
Mind our own business?

299
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,655
Give the man back his money
and go the fuck away?

300
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,885
Pretty much.

301
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,660
Except he said a few things
for my benefit, too.

302
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,492
Like how I had shit all over him.

303
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,896
Like how he was
shutting us down this week.

304
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,127
-The fuck he is.
-We're done.

305
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,471
I go past Friday, and I'm buried.
He told me that.

306
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,736
He's gonna bury you? For what?
You're doing your fucking job.

307
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:08,803
You think the job is gonna save me?
You think it's gonna save you?

308
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:11,882
Chain-of-command.
That's all I got from the Deputy, today.

309
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,314
Chain-of-command?

310
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,814
Did you tell your major about the
senator's driver? Or the Colonel?

311
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:19,048
No? Then where's your chain-of-command?

312
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:23,457
What's the shift lieutenant doing
going up the back stairs to the Deputy Ops?

313
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,564
-What are you saying?
-Nothing.

314
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,796
Goddamn right.

315
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:35,169
Why, he got something on you?

316
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,934
You say you got the Deputy's ear.
What the fuck's he got on you?

317
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:40,738
Only rank, Detective.

318
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,697
Yo, Stink. What about the rules, yo?

319
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,631
Special occasion, yo.

320
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,980
Yo, Bey.

321
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,325
-I'm gonna throw up.
-No, you ain't.

322
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,028
Burrell thinks I crossed him.

323
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,228
He said this to you?

324
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,328
In so many words.

325
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,464
-You need to explain then--
-Explain what?

326
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,337
That I'm bringing in a case
that goes everywhere?

327
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,071
Today, it was some senator's driver.

328
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:57,670
Two days from now,
a city councilman, maybe.

329
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:01,076
He asked for a charge on Barksdale.
That's all he asked for.

330
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:04,177
This thing with the legislative aide,
who could've foreseen it?

331
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:07,052
He saw it. Burrell.

332
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,129
See, this is the thing
that everyone knows and no one says.

333
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,698
You follow the drugs, you get a drug case.

334
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,164
You start following the money,
you don't know where you're going.

335
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,228
That's why they don't want wiretaps or
wired Cls or anything they can't control.

336
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,709
Because once that tape starts rolling,
who the hell knows what's going to be said?

337
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,679
That son of a bitch McNulty asked me
what the Deputy had on me.

338
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,279
He actually asked me that.

339
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:37,849
What did you say?

340
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:05,514
Where everybody go? Where the girls go?

341
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,210
Fuck it, man, party broke.

342
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:11,087
We drunked out and fucked out.

343
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,250
You all send me out for liquor,
and by the time I get back, the shit is dead?

344
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:16,885
Look at this.

345
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,690
The Knicks done fucked up their draft again.

346
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,366
What's with her?

347
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,865
Oh, fucked her silly. What can I say?

348
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:37,774
She snorted half the shit we brought up
in here, too, that greedy bitch.

349
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,999
Yo, Bey.

350
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,254
-You wanted to see us?
-What the hell is this?

351
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,056
I got copied this morning.

352
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,665
It's just what it looks like.

353
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:33,066
A memo signed by the Deputy Ops, Rawls
and Forester, telling us to pack it in.

354
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:38,040
We come down on the wire by Friday,
ship the computers to the DEA by Monday...

355
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:40,702
and charge whoever we have
by the end of next week.

356
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,642
Yeah? Who do you have?

357
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:46,939
Couple of mid-level guys.
Anton Artis, a.k.a. Stinkum.

358
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,584
Shooter named Bird,
wanted for killing Gant.

359
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,518
He was the witness in your court.

360
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:54,352
-That's it?
-Except for a couple of hangers-on, yeah.

361
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,359
Why are they doing this? Why now?

362
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:00,191
We picked up a bag man
coming out of the high-rises...

363
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,198
carrying $20,000 in cash, yesterday.

364
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,768
-So?
-So, he works for Clay Davis.

365
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,235
Of the 39th Legislative District.

366
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,697
The deputy was displeased.

367
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,299
It's okay, though.

368
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,775
We gave the money back,
said we were sorry.

369
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,108
-What can Daniels do?
-Not a fucking thing.

370
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:20,983
The Deputy sent him the same direct order
you have on your desk right there.

371
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,848
Get me Burrell on the line!

372
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:27,655
Detectives, when you swore
that your affidavit was true...

373
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:32,218
to the best of your ability,
what did the Circuit Court of Baltimore do?

374
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:36,633
-You gave us the wire.
-For how long, Detective McNulty?

375
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,201
Sixty days, no?

376
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:41,328
And how long have you monitored
these phone extensions?

377
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:42,766
Forty days, maybe.

378
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:44,773
Deputy Burrell is on the line.

379
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,636
Erv, it's Phelan.

380
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,408
Kiddo, you're fucking with me here.

381
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,410
Yes, you are.

382
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,414
Erv, listen to me.

383
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:01,320
The Circuit Court signed two orders...

384
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:04,189
for a total of 60 days
of telephonic surveillance.

385
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,287
Now, I'm looking at a copy
of a memo from your office...

386
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,525
telling me I can't have my 60 days.

387
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,899
You're not hearing me.

388
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,873
The Circuit Court for Baltimore
ordered 60 days on this tap.

389
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,444
The Court wants its 60 days.

390
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,012
Now, if you take this wire down on Friday,
you'll be in contempt of court on Monday.

391
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,745
Understood?

392
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,552
And all the best to Arlene and the kids.

393
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,679
Yeah.

394
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,457
Who's your daddy now?

395
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,772
Look, I didn't do a damn thing, Lieutenant.
You got a beef, it's with the judge.

396
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,909
Yeah, he got the Deputy's memo,
he called his own shot.

397
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,448
Ask Greggs if you don't believe me.

398
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,682
Look, I've got to go.

399
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:37,878
Kima.

400
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,522
Deputy called, mad as the devil.

401
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,532
Tell them to quit packing.
We're back up on the wire.

402
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,802
Kima.

403
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,040
McNulty or the judge? Or both?

404
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,665
This time, the judge.

405
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,885
Ask me a question. Any question.

406
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,881
I thought you weren't studying.

407
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,787
This job is common sense.
Ask me a question, dickless.

408
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,325
See how I do.

409
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:19,427
"According to Q1--"

410
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,623
Hold up, help me out, here.
You have to know them by the numbers?

411
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,429
It helps.

412
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,636
Makes it sound more professional that way.

413
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,998
"According to Q1 ...

414
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,676
"the general order
covering sexual harassment...

415
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,542
"in the event a female officer
in your squad complains...

416
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,138
"that her side partner
has sexually harassed her...

417
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,410
"you should:

418
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,146
"A: Notify the commanding officer.

419
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:46,245
"B: Notify the shift lieutenant.

420
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,888
"C: Notify the ranking female officer."

421
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:53,458
I go with D.

422
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,024
D?

423
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,500
Yeah, bitch-slap the side partner
for dipping into my private stock...

424
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:02,367
then take missy home
and fuck her till she smiles.

425
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,857
What the hell?

426
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:58,625
When a small change in price
creates a large change in demand...

427
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:03,166
then demand is said to be elastic,
but some products are inelastic.

428
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,327
Meaning, a change in price
does not affect demand.

429
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:11,170
Some key factors that affect
the elasticity of demand are what?

430
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,641
-Mr. Bell?
-Desire.

431
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,202
Consumer need.

432
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:19,942
Right, specifically, the ability of a consumer
to delay acquisition. What else?

433
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,582
My pencil lost its point.

434
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,212
All the girls say so.

435
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,595
Damon, we got work orders here,
and ain't nothing happening.

436
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,064
These jobs were due yesterday,
and people going to be coming in here...

437
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,499
asking for their work
and nothing been done.

438
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,969
Man, fuck them. Let them wait.

439
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:19,133
No, you are not going to bring that
corner bullshit up in here, you hear me?

440
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,701
You know what we got here?

441
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,373
We got an elastic product.
You know what that mean?

442
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:29,816
That mean when people can go elsewhere
and get their printing and copying done...

443
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,909
they gonna do it.

444
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:34,013
You acting like we got
an inelastic product and we don't.

445
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:38,083
Now, I want this to run
like a true fucking business.

446
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,291
Not no front, not no bullshit.

447
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,594
Understand me?

448
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,266
I'm serious.

449
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,534
-Where you snatch this old wreck from?
-Out Frederick Road.

450
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,807
Ditch it over Eastside when we done.

451
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,843
Check it.
Him there, and that other fool there.

452
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:06,122
They the only ones might be trouble.

453
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,056
I'll drop Scar,
you just drop that other motherfucker.

454
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:13,459
No, just Scar.
His boy break, we going to let him.

455
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:17,699
-But if he raise up, I'm on him, see?
-Damn, I wish Bird was here, man.

456
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,632
Bird be loving this shit right here.

457
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,297
Which do remind me,
we get up out of here...

458
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,000
you need to drop that shit
down a storm drain.

459
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,010
Now give me some time
to go around the block...

460
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,740
and set up on the other side, all right?

461
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,546
What up, who got black tops?

462
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,553
Hey, now.

463
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,025
What the fuck?

464
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,160
Listen here, Bey.

465
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:57,128
You come at the king, you best not miss.

466
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,741
-Stink's been got.
-Stink?

467
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:43,210
-Bey caught one, too, in the leg.
-Shit, man, what happened?

468
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:46,771
-They down the gulley on Edmondson.
-Fucking Scar, man.

469
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,376
-No, it ain't him. Omar, man.
-Omar?

470
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,148
Bounty's going up on that bitch.

471
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,416
That fucks us.

472
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,516
We had Stinkum tied up with a bow
from the arrest of the runner...

473
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:57,928
and now he's out of the case.

474
00:39:58,128 --> 00:40:00,528
The man's a fucking loose cannon.

475
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,031
-Literally.
-We've got to pull his ass up at least.

476
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,369
There's a dime on this cocksucker's head.

477
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:10,232
One of you motherfuckers needs to step up.

478
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,005
-Where you go with that?
-Maryland General.

479
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,547
Walked up in there and told them
I was on the corner, caught a stray.

480
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,378
-Police come talk to you?
-Just a roller, no homicide.

481
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,078
-Put it out there.
-Not just our people, either.

482
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,985
I'm talking about any nigger
who wants to step up.

483
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:27,414
Put out the word.

484
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:30,516
There's $10,000 on Omar
or any motherfucker standing with Omar.

485
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,687
Y'all niggers ain't got shit to do
but be on this motherfuckin' hunt.

486
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:35,992
-Now be on it.
-All right.

487
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,840
So, what you think, homes?

488
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,114
I'm thinking this is the worst
part of the game.

489
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:58,279
-Best we do is break out even, right?
-What?

490
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:02,757
I'm saying, this shit got personal.
Ain't nothing else to it.

491
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:08,698
-So, you talking about letting it slide.
-For a time, maybe.

492
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:12,761
I'm saying we put the word out
that you ready to talk a truce.

493
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,203
When this nigger come out
from underneath his rock, you hit him.

494
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:19,742
But right now? This shit got out of hand.

495
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,733
What you want me to say?

496
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,910
Look, I don't know nothing
about Stink getting dropped...

497
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,004
and I don't know nothing
about Bey getting shot, either.

498
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:02,142
-I don't know about this crazy nonsense.
-I don't know, it came back to us quick.

499
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:04,015
You know how that be.

500
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,783
Everybody want to believe
the worst about Omar.

501
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,486
But live and let live, you know?

502
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,153
I don't see you letting
them slide on Brandon.

503
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:14,526
If I was coming after certain people...

504
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:18,499
I definitely wouldn't want to give
y'all fine people any cause for concern.

505
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,297
There are rules here, right?

506
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,099
-Rules?
-Yeah.

507
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:25,072
No mistakes, no bystanders.

508
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:28,076
No taxpayers getting caught up in the mix.

509
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,243
I mean, you just get in close
and you hit the right nigger.

510
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:34,579
And lose the gun afterward,
that'd be a rule, too, I think.

511
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,243
One thing, Omar.

512
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,981
Having Stinkum dropped
kind of fucks us on our thing.

513
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,351
How so?

514
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,823
We had Stink caught
with 4 G-packs on a re-up.

515
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:45,258
And maybe we could've built
something on that.

516
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,627
-Roll him up with Stringer, maybe.
-Now he's got no roll to him.

517
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,292
So, the point is, Omar,
while we're all grateful...

518
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:55,929
for the case you gave us on Bird,
and we admire your do-it-yourself nature--

519
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,064
We need you to hang back.

520
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,709
Look, man, it ain't all up to me, right?

521
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,642
I got a bounty on my head.

522
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,149
Yeah, we saw the van.

523
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:15,484
Look, man, I do what I can do
to help you all, but the game is out there.

524
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,522
And it's either play or get played.

525
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,363
What, that it?

526
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,568
Gentlemen. Ma'am.

527
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,206
Lester, are we still cops?

528
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:43,414
-Technically, I suppose so.
-Okay, I was just checking.

529
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:48,815
Keisha ain't called, and she ain't been home.
How was she when you left her?

530
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:52,019
She was sick, I told you that.

531
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:56,589
She missed work last night and she ain't
been down there to pick up her check today.

532
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,937
You know something?

533
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:05,063
This game...

534
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:07,705
this thing with my uncle...

535
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,344
might not be right for me, I'm thinking.

536
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,606
Why do you say that?

537
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,243
Nothing good to it but the money.

538
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,280
Sounds a lot like my job.

539
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:23,524
I mean, you got people using each other.

540
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,726
Scamming each other.

541
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,361
Cutting each other up
because they're late on a bill.

542
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,666
Shooting folks because
there might be a fucking dollar in it.

543
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:44,480
It gets to sometime
like I can't even fucking breathe.

544
00:44:45,148 --> 00:44:48,345
Like I can't even get no air.
You know what I mean?

545
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:52,582
Do something else.

546
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,086
-So, you happy with your job?
-Shit.

547
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,919
Well then, do something else.

548
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,055
I am. I'm going to have to. Shit.

549
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,929
Can't stay pretty forever.

550
00:45:14,177 --> 00:45:17,169
It's not forever, right, Dee?

551
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,375
And then what?

552
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,185
You pretty now.

553
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:34,757
Now we pretty.

554
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:10,762
You got me, holler back.

555
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,761
Dee, man.

556
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,600
Raise up and roll in quick.
Stink been got, man.

557
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:19,504
You hear me? They got Stink.

558
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,844
I need your help.

559
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,621
Who caught the one
from Edmondson last night? Anton Artis.

560
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:33,951
Cole, with an assist from Dunnigan.

561
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:42,755
-Omar was the shooter.
-Fuck me.

562
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,562
It's all over the wiretap.

563
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,469
Okay, let's see.

564
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,598
We put down one murder on the testimony
of one eyewitness...

565
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,471
who then goes out and drops
somebody else.

566
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,273
Yeah, it was payback
for his boyfriend, Brandon.

567
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,348
Anton Artis is Stinkum, one of the boys
who snatched Brandon and did him up.

568
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,918
I'm sure that motherfucker
had his reasons, Jimmy--

569
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:06,223
You want to give back the Gant case,
then tell Cole the name of his shooter.

570
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:06,689
You want to give back the Gant case,
then tell Cole the name of his shooter.

571
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,384
Otherwise, tell him we're hearing talk
on the wire...

572
00:47:09,492 --> 00:47:12,825
and we'll give him his clearance
once we wrap our case.

573
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:15,992
But you won't.

574
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,061
No, we won't.

575
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,036
You want me to go and bullshit Cole
out of his case for you?

576
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,767
-Why don't you go tell him yourself?
-Are you kidding?

577
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:30,209
If Rawls sees my fingerprints on this,
he'll run my nuts through a cheese grater.

578
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,418
Fuck you, Jimmy.

579
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:43,650
-How's it going with it?
-Pretty good.

580
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,888
I like this kid who's fucking
my victim's old girlfriend.

581
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,630
Ray, can I talk to you for a minute?

582
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,236
In my office.

583
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,648
With cases like this one,
you are put in some strange fucking places.

584
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,885
Cole's doing good this year,
he don't need the clearance.

585
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,760
All right, I know this fucks him.

586
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:25,460
You should've seen his face when I told him
you'd give him his shooter down the road.

587
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,361
He's happy?

588
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:33,168
Yeah. He looked at me like a damn puppy.

589
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,303
-I'm sorry, Bunk.
-I'll carry it.

590
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:39,180
Fuck it.

591
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,384
No, tonight's mine.

592
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,923
Look, I'll tell you what, I'm going to roll out.

593
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:55,731
Here's the money
I would've spent on your ass.

594
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,164
Jimmy.

595
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,303
Call Nadine and tell her I caught one,
and I'm out on the street.

596
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:15,444
I lied for you, didn't l?

597
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,061
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, what's up?

598
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,966
I think I might have fucked something up.

599
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,197
Yeah?

600
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,772
I'm interviewing Omar, a few weeks back.

601
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:45,508
And he's giving it to me
that Bird is the shooter in the Gant case.

602
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:49,148
He tells me, if we catch up to Bird,
he'll have the gun on him.

603
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,583
Which he does.

604
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,917
But the thing is I told him that
we needed an eyeball witness.

605
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:57,219
At which point, he volunteers.

606
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,486
Maybe he saw it.

607
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,893
Or maybe he put himself in it
just to see Bird locked up.

608
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,528
I got the impression there
wasn't much love between them.

609
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,673
I fucked up, didn't l?

610
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,206
A little. But the gun matches.

611
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,944
And he's consistent with our witness
on the description and the scenario.

612
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:22,017
So, don't sweat it.

613
00:50:22,118 --> 00:50:23,312
Kima.

614
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:27,422
You know, interrogation
is more art than science.

615
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,721
You've got to feel your way through
on instinct, mostly.

616
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:37,261
Come, take a look at this.

617
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,465
Who are they?

618
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,600
Some dancers who work at Barksdale's club.

619
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,573
I pulled their names
off of liquor board complaints...

620
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,773
and state employment records.

621
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:59,153
If you were going to try to turn
one these girls, which one would it be?

622
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,049
Her.

623
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,384
Why?

624
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:08,824
She doesn't have a record, for one thing.
She's just a DMV photo.

625
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,194
Why else?

626
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,867
I don't know. I can't really say.

627
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,467
I like her face.

628
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:18,538
Soul, conscience, whatever you want
to call it. She's a citizen, right?

629
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,540
It's in the eyes.

630
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:24,474
Instinct, Detective.

631
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,383
Yeah?

632
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,716
What?

633
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,461
Who is this?

634
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:43,855
He did?

635
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,360
How the hell did you get my number?

636
00:51:51,674 --> 00:51:52,800
Yeah, okay.

637
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,675
Yeah.

638
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:02,509
-Ma'am?
-Get this crazy bastard out of here.

639
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,850
-What's the matter?
-He set off the smoke alarm, twice.

640
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:07,684
That good?

641
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:10,048
In the bathroom.

642
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,361
Bunk, it's Jimmy.

643
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:17,732
What the fuck?

644
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,462
Bunk, wake the fuck up.

645
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,672
-Bunk, wake up.
-What?

646
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,706
-The fuck are you doing?
-I hear you, Jimmy.

647
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,271
What are you doing?
Where are your fucking clothes?

648
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:33,546
Right here.

649
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,184
-Who gives a shit?
-Come on, man.

650
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,276
No.

651
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:41,918
What did you burn your clothes for, man?

652
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:48,290
Got hair, got fibers and...

653
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,030
got pussy on it and....

654
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,366
What, trace evidence?

655
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:57,266
You smell pussy?
I don't smell no pussy no more.

656
00:52:57,373 --> 00:53:00,934
-Knock it off.
-I think you all can just take my ass home.

657
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:04,178
Trace lab ain't going
to have shit on the Bunk.

658
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,649
That shit. No fucking case file, Detective.

659
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:11,111
Where are your fucking shoes, man?

660
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:14,820
Ma'am, you seen his shoes?

661
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,417
Give me that pussy,
and now you going to take my shoes?

662
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,597
That ain't right, shit.

663
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:10,872
Shit.

664
00:54:11,614 --> 00:54:13,104
Christ, Jimmy.

665
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:20,778
Bunk, I'll give you that
burning trace evidence makes sense.

666
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,556
What the fuck did you plan to wear home?

667
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:28,362
Shit.

668
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,799
Jimmy, you know something?

669
00:54:35,004 --> 00:54:37,529
You're no good for people, man.

670
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,634
I mean, damn. Everybody around you....

671
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,410
Christ.

672
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:56,410
