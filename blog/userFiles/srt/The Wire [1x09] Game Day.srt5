1
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,917
Him on the ball, from Dunbar.

2
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,217
He junior college now,
but he going to bigger places...

3
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:26,291
if he can make them grades.

4
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,621
He our edge, right there.

5
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,194
-Where he going?
-I don't know.

6
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:41,601
Terps, Hoyas, Missouri, Kansas,
they all want this cat.

7
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:45,268
Okay, so we in the mix, too, now.
You know what I'm talking about?

8
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:49,072
Blow Proposition Joe's mind.
He ain't got nobody balling like this.

9
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,582
He better not have one motherfucker
balling like this.

10
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,209
I'm tired of losing to
these Eastside bitches every year.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,256
It's been three years running now, man.
Fucking with my morale, for real.

12
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,952
What happened to the faggot?

13
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,530
Omar?

14
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,762
-That nigger in the winds, man.
-What you mean he in the wind, man?

15
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,836
This city ain't that big.

16
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,866
You know what that nigger do
when he holed up somewhere?

17
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:20,169
He peel off one or two packages,
roll around the neighborhood...

18
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,270
giving away free vials and shit.

19
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,884
Yeah, on some real Robin Hood type shit.
If we try and get at him...

20
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,784
we going to have two dozen niggers
saying that we on our way.

21
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,824
If you want us to hunt that nigger,
we going to hunt.

22
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,827
But the smart play, I think, we call a truce...

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,096
put this thing on hold for a hot second.

24
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,932
Let the faggot get comfortable...

25
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:45,026
and when he do, he'll pop up his head.
Boom, we got him.

26
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,970
What will motherfuckers be saying
while we waiting?

27
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,300
What people going to say...

28
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,606
when they see this
cocksucking faggot out in the sunshine?

29
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,278
Like it ain't no thing to take my shit.

30
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:07,852
-Kid's everything I said he was?
-Yeah, he is straight.

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,656
Don't know what we're going to do
without him next year.

32
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,698
-How come you ain't signed?
-Lot of schools looking at me.

33
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,825
-I'm listening.
-$10,000, though, that ain't bad, right?

34
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:21,032
-It ain't.
-$10,000 for the kid, plus $5,000...

35
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,808
donation for the program.

36
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,668
Done.

37
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,572
Good. Give me 30 from the line
and get out of here.

38
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,411
Yo, man, good job, baby.

39
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,451
All right, big guy.

40
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:40,520
And I assume there's another $5,000
right here, for making this happen?

41
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,722
Ain't shit for free, right?

42
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,818
So, what you do for money?

43
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,658
Can't live without it, right?

44
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,290
You still fucked up
behind that stickup, man?

45
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,403
Shit ain't on you. It ain't on me neither.

46
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,135
Motherfucker who robbed
the stash shot Sterling.

47
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,301
He gonna get got
no matter what you or me do.

48
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,278
I just don't wanna play.
I don't wanna play no more.

49
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,369
All right?

50
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:45,382
I was thinking about going
to school, over at Edmondson...

51
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,044
ask if they'll let me back in
at the end of the semester.

52
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,384
-What grade?
-Ninth.

53
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:53,014
Ninth? Shit, you how old?

54
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,387
Sixteen.

55
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:57,792
Sixteen. Damn, man, you supposed
to be a junior by now.

56
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,991
I heard Stinkum got killed.

57
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,793
Yeah.

58
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,796
Damn.

59
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,708
-I said I don't want to play.
-I heard you.

60
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,750
And you ain't got to do nothing.

61
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,046
I heard you. Take it.

62
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,514
Hurry up, nigger, people looking.

63
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:26,682
Look here, man,
you a smart little motherfucker.

64
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,118
You start back up at Edmondson...

65
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:33,221
you likely to finish up at Harvard
or some shit like that. Believe, B.

66
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,426
And you got a good heart in there, too.

67
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,932
Not like the rest of these niggers.

68
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,473
-Yeah?
-Ronnie Mo on Tower Phone 2.

69
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,752
Right.

70
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,855
Where the fuck you at, man?
You coming to get this shit or what?

71
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,446
Keep cool, we making rounds.

72
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:02,459
-You know I ain't moving like I used to.
-All right, couple hours, we be at you.

73
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:03,619
All right.

74
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,765
Wee-Bey picking up at the towers?

75
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,632
-In a couple hours, give or take.
-Time enough for us to make a play.

76
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,332
What's up with Wallace?

77
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,567
Nothing.

78
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:19,666
Nothing?

79
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,246
Nothing.

80
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,112
It's all good, just leave him be.

81
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,314
Damn.

82
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,449
Fuck.

83
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,821
I'm tired of not having a phone
up in this joint.

84
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,625
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah.

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,891
-Have a nice hike.
-Yeah.

86
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,582
-Hello, you make order?
-Who this?

87
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,710
You make order? Good yakame.

88
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,521
-What?
-Or no delivery.

89
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,888
You make order, you come get.
Good yakame, good noodle.

90
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,424
Extra ketchup.

91
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,463
What the fuck was that?

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,195
That was my Korean counterman.

93
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,961
Sounded Chinese.

94
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,206
Like you can fucking tell the difference.

95
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,609
It's a brave new world for you, boys.

96
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,447
1 2-14.

97
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,318
-Request a lateral with 1 2-08.
-Go ahead, 14.

98
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,018
08, can you go to Channel 3?

99
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,989
1 2-08, I got that.

100
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,459
-Where you at?
-McCullough above Preston.

101
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,195
We're on a good pay phone
that the pit boys are now using.

102
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,703
I'm up on the church. Hang close, boys.

103
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,467
Might have a nicejack-up for you two.

104
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,811
I can't believe these boys
still in business, man.

105
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,046
-Testers, testers coming in five.
-What's the new package, man?

106
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,349
Yellow tops. Shit is the bomb.

107
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,320
-Now shit is the bomb.
-Check it.

108
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:17,122
A man who wants to get high
more than he wants to get clean.

109
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,789
-He was doing good, too.
-Told you, it was bullshit.

110
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,528
-Them meetings were just fronts.
-The man sounded strong, you know?

111
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,330
Whatever.

112
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,229
It's about that time.

113
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,840
-Shit.
-What happened?

114
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,903
That's the boy who beat me down, man.

115
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,682
The shits right here is
yellow tops and they right...

116
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:41,685
so remember where you caught this blast
and tell your fiend-ass friends.

117
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,846
Line the fuck up.

118
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,857
Back up.

119
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,984
Get in line, what the fuck? Line the fuck up.

120
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,589
Get the fuck out of here. Damn, fuck you all.

121
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,401
Hurry up. Over here.

122
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,906
Get one, girl, over here. I got one.

123
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,699
You get one?

124
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,471
Hold up. You catch one?

125
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,208
You know, I got three if you need.

126
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,877
You was at the meeting
over at Samuel Morse.

127
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,716
Mr. One-Day Man. It wasn't even that.

128
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,823
Stood up, though.

129
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,256
Why you down at the tester line
if you ain't chasing?

130
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,351
Trying to get my little nephew
off the corner.

131
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,987
His mama sent him up to Cumberland,
you know?

132
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,692
Try to keep him clean at my grandma's.

133
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,602
He ain't anywhere near his bottom.

134
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:34,064
Got to see that bottom coming up at him.

135
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,573
Hard, too, 'cause he's young, 24.

136
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:39,872
Most people don't get tired
till they're 35, 40.

137
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,841
-How old are you?
-Young at heart.

138
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,115
Walon, man.

139
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,678
Bubs.

140
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,097
Give them a long rope.

141
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,691
The farther away from the projects
you pop him, the less risk to the wire.

142
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:04,826
Hell with the wire.

143
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,463
Excuse me?

144
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,006
Gotcha, McNulty, you're too easy.

145
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,445
You can come at this a few ways.

146
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:22,349
First thing is we need the names
of all front companies...

147
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,922
Iimited partnerships,
LLCs, and all that mess.

148
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,720
-LLCs?
-Limited liability corporations.

149
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,088
Start with the nightclub
which Barksdale owns.

150
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:34,962
Look up Orlando's, by address, you
match it, and you see it's owned by who?

151
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,598
It's on Baltimore Street, right?

152
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,708
Got it. D & B enterprises.

153
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,973
Give it to Prez,
who's going to get off his ass...

154
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,107
and walk on over to
the state office buildings on Preston Street.

155
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,583
-Preston Street?
-Corporate charter office.

156
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,153
Corporate who?

157
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,317
They have the paperwork
on every corporation and LLC...

158
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,586
Iicensed to do business in the state.

159
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,752
You look up D & B Enterprises
on the computer.

160
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,057
You're going to get a little reel of microfilm.

161
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,599
Pull the corporate charter papers that way...

162
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,726
write down every name you see.:

163
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,295
corporate officers, shareholders,
or more importantly...

164
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:19,104
the resident agent on the filing
who is usually a lawyer.

165
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,544
While they use front names,
you know, as corporate officers...

166
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,776
they'll usually use the same lawyer
to do the charter filing.

167
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:28,284
Find that agent's name,
run it through the computer...

168
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,254
find out what other corporations
he's done the filing for...

169
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,722
and that way we find other front companies.

170
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,794
While he's doing that, what do I do?

171
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,328
You're gonna to keep your head
in this assessment book.

172
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,627
Look up any properties
that you can connect to Barksdale.

173
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,224
How do you know
it connects to Barksdale, right?

174
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,828
You work off of what Prez gets you
from the corporate charter documents.

175
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,467
Whatever companies he links to Barksdale
or people connected to him...

176
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,569
you look for those companies
in the city land records.

177
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,910
For example:
McNulty said that he heard that Barksdale...

178
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,145
owned an apartment building
up on Druid Park Lake.

179
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,484
You look up all the blocks on Reservoir Hill.

180
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,218
See if there's anything
owned by D & B Enterprises...

181
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,419
or any other company that Prez finds...

182
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,962
through corporate charter
or anything similar.

183
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,057
Ifyou find something that fits,
you write down the folio number...

184
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,568
so that you can look it up later
at the courthouse.

185
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,069
You don't find anything...

186
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,472
just take the names of all the corporate
listings for the multi-units near the lake.

187
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:28,444
You call that list over to Prez,
who pulls the charter papers...

188
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,482
and he'll look for connections.

189
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,813
-It's like a scavenger hunt.
-But what if Barksdale is careful?

190
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,150
I mean, what if we can't
find his name on anything?

191
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,617
In this country...

192
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,591
somebody's name
has got to be on a piece of paper.

193
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:44,821
A cousin, a girlfriend,
a grandmother, a lieutenant he can trust...

194
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,693
somebody's name is on a piece of paper.

195
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,459
And here's the rub:

196
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,396
You follow drugs...

197
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,464
you get drug addicts and drug dealers.

198
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,899
But you start to follow the money...

199
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,172
and you don't know where
the fuck it's going to take you.

200
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,045
While we're running around on this,
what are you going to do?

201
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,586
-You need something?
-Yeah.

202
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,417
Let me get the...

203
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:14,617
campaign financial reports
for the western districts...

204
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:16,819
and actually, any citywide race.

205
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,693
You want quarterly reports
or individual donor lists?

206
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,199
-Both, please.
-It'll be a couple hundred pages.

207
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,800
Really? I'll take all of it.

208
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,645
What the fuck, man?

209
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,079
With your right hand,
reach for the window, open the door.

210
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:45,156
-Come on, hurry up, man.
-Step out of the car.

211
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,491
Drop the cane, toss the cane.
Come around to the back.

212
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,495
All right.

213
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,291
Turn around.

214
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,869
Sir, is there anything in the vehicle
we should know about?

215
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,063
Nope.

216
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,732
No guns, drugs?

217
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,907
Me ain't got shit.

218
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,450
This money right here,
I didn't just pull this out of your truck?

219
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,787
What money?

220
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,228
Damn, we'll be counting
this limp-dick cash all day.

221
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,459
Where you guys going with all this?

222
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:32,126
Like the man said, it ain't ours.

223
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,702
It ain't yours?

224
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:36,171
So, you don't mind if we just
take it off your hands?

225
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,142
Do what you feel. You pretending to take
money out this truck.

226
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,643
I didn't even know it was there.

227
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,941
You know, I know how that shit is.

228
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,211
The other day,
I took up the sofa cushions off my couch...

229
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,082
found $1 .40 I didn't even know was there.

230
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,357
You all ain't got no charge, right?

231
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:02,028
No, fucker, we do not have a charge.
We just got your money.

232
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,499
You want it back, you can explain
it to the state's attorney where you got it.

233
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,973
You all enjoy your day now, you hear?

234
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:16,876
As I wake up in the morning
And get out of my bed

235
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:18,647
Give me three.

236
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,910
As I wake up in the morning
And get out of my bed

237
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,681
I'm thinking about the people
I grew up with long dead

238
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:59,018
The brothers I grew up with, locked up

239
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,989
I'm freestyling off the top of my head

240
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,561
You know, it's swell, Patti LaBelle I like her

241
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,357
But Regina Bell is better

242
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,640
Motherfucker!

243
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,953
Motherfucker, trying to steal our shit.

244
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,860
Motherfucker!

245
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,498
-Fished your wish, Bubbs?
-Yeah.

246
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,443
And you should've seen
the one that got away.

247
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,910
I nearly got killed behind this caper,
you know?

248
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,418
It's all in the game, Bubbs.

249
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,720
Yeah?

250
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:48,990
This ain't shit.

251
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,794
I'm not high, neither.

252
00:17:55,707 --> 00:18:00,007
It's fucking Arm & Hammer.
We just been firing baking soda.

253
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,438
It's all right, man.
I'll just come up with another plan.

254
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,540
I did it once, right?

255
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,466
Fuck me.

256
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:46,790
Carv, you go to a restaurant...

257
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,594
and say the waitress gives you
good, decent service.

258
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:51,957
How much do you tip?

259
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,428
How much do I tip?

260
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,032
-For good service.
-I don't know, 15%.

261
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:04,832
-Some people tip 20%.
-Some people got money.

262
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,176
What you think Wee-Bey would tip?

263
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,307
You'd be a clever motherfucker
if there wasn't a wiretap running.

264
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,109
What do you mean?

265
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:26,091
Say we turn in $20,000, and this afternoon,
the bosses are listening to the wiretap...

266
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:28,631
and they hear we took $30,000
out of that car.

267
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,531
Didn't think of that, did you?

268
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:37,670
We're finding a lot of stuff
on the west side of downtown...

269
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,939
that might be his,
over by that Howard Street corridor.

270
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,038
-What kind of property?
-Low-rent commercials.

271
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:45,710
A lot of vacants.

272
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,014
The fuck does Avon Barksdale want
with a string of empty storefronts?

273
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,180
-This feels premature.
-What does?

274
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,416
Chasing up assets.

275
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,550
We're not close to putting
a charge to the man.

276
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,754
-That should be the priority.
-We put a charge to Avon Barksdale...

277
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:01,024
the Deputy shuts us down,
tells us to go home.

278
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:04,761
You want the money side of this case,
it's now or never, Lieutenant.

279
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,203
I'm working here.

280
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,236
Maybe $20,000 or $30,000.

281
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,038
Dollars for donuts.

282
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,113
You should've seen the looks on their faces.

283
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,706
-What did Wee-Bey say?
-"What money?"

284
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,048
The only hassle is
we need to sit here and count this shit.

285
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:27,090
-Do the ECU Submissions.
-And it's all limp-dick, dime-vial money.

286
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,451
Dirty bills right off the corner.

287
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:30,295
You all got the pit boys
on a fresh pay phone, right?

288
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,024
You all got the pit boys
on a fresh pay phone, right?

289
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,098
-Yeah, on McCullough.
-You take pictures?

290
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,657
Good, we're gonna need an additional
affidavit to get up on that phone.

291
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,737
Another 30 days, McNulty?

292
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,903
What the fuck did I do?

293
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,411
One day he fights,
the next day he's ready to roll over.

294
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,176
-Does he want this fucking case or not?
-Give him some slack, Jimmy.

295
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,185
He's wrestling with the angels on this one.

296
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,353
Where's my lucky pen?

297
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,083
-You ready, bitch?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

298
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,093
I wanna get on my knees
and suck you like a great big lollipop.

299
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,993
-Yeah, suck it.
-Yeah, I know that's your favorite.

300
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,700
Let me lick that. You like that?

301
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,132
I want you to butt-fuck me.

302
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,931
We're supposed to turn off the tap
when it's non-pertinent.

303
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,907
Fuck, no, this is too good.

304
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,876
-Fuck me.
-Daddy, yeah.

305
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,306
There's no way I'm transcribing this stuff.

306
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,345
Touch yourself.

307
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,511
Yeah.

308
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:05,788
-My pussy is so wet right now.
-Phone sex?

309
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,818
Shit was hilarious.

310
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,820
You're supposed to shut down
after 90 seconds if it's non-pertinent.

311
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,592
You're gonna to look like
a glazed donut, you know that?

312
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,064
Is that right?

313
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:19,068
I'm gonna get there and fuck you
in all three holes.

314
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,170
-So, you're gonna come past here?
-Tomorrow, yeah.

315
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:27,574
But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight.

316
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,442
-Check in with Wallace.
-Wallace?

317
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,811
He's off the hook since
we helped the tower crew...

318
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,817
get that stickup boy.
I'm telling you, Wallace is bugging.

319
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,387
Don't hardly even come
out of that room no more.

320
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,424
-Why he be like that?
-I think he might be getting high.

321
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,993
-Wallace?
-Boy scaring me with his shit.

322
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:45,892
-All right, you holler at me later.
-That'll work.

323
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,694
Pertinent now, right?

324
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,961
If you can explain
why we're still on the line...

325
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,536
after 10 minutes jerking off.

326
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,502
You got to justify that.

327
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,133
Maybe three holes was the code
for three stash houses.

328
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,909
Omar.

329
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,383
Omar coming.

330
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,082
-Did you hear me? I said Omar coming.
-Let's get out of here.

331
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,058
I said, Omar coming through.

332
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,032
Somebody in trouble now.
Come on, let's go.

333
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,090
You all need to open this door, man,
before I huff and puff.

334
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,492
Come on, now,
by the hairs of your chinny-chin-chin.

335
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,295
Omar, you best roll out,
we up in here with a MAC-10.

336
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,563
I thinks not, Terrell, I thinks not.

337
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:04,173
You all might need to think this through
and stop wasting my time.

338
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,539
Because Omar can come back tomorrow.

339
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,437
And the next day.

340
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:11,979
And the next day.

341
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,987
And I will put a bullet in all you all behind,
what happen right now, you heard?

342
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,834
Fair enough.

343
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,909
Here you go, keep it.

344
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,984
How do you wanna play it?

345
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,878
Hard and tight, like she's got no choice.

346
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,254
-Shardene Ennis.
-Miss, we need to talk.

347
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:56,057
-About what?
-It's a downtown talk.

348
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,651
This way. Come on.

349
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,692
Give me a two and two.

350
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,182
-What's up?
-What you got?

351
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,485
Family affair, two-for-one, you up?

352
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,589
-No. Not me.
-All right.

353
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,772
How you figure these little pebbles
get up on top of the roof?

354
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,439
Where's everybody at?

355
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,571
Maybe the whole thing is over
and no one bothered to tell us.

356
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,877
Maybe we won.

357
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,354
Something ain't right.

358
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,451
Come on, let's take a ride.

359
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,297
I like these.

360
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:14,368
-The toy furniture is great.
-Doll house miniatures.

361
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,067
It's a hobby.

362
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,710
My sister had a dollhouse
when we were young, but...

363
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,939
nothing as nice as these. Can l?

364
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,341
Sure, babe.

365
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,516
That's a walnut marble-top vanity.

366
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:34,152
Renaissance revival, late 19th century.

367
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,553
Do you have a house for them?

368
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,198
No, I just make them and sell them.

369
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
That seems kind of sad.

370
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,868
You should have a house for them.

371
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,712
We can use the Lieutenant's office.

372
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:21,162
-No.
-I ain't asked for nothing.

373
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:27,168
What's up, Tasha? You got too pretty, girl.

374
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,609
Go inside, Tash.

375
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,450
I'm thinking about getting clean.

376
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,114
Again.

377
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:49,027
I was thinking, you know,
I ain't got no other place to go, maybe....

378
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,626
That's wrong, right?

379
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,364
That ain't right, right? Sorry.

380
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,505
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,868
Wait.

382
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:15,782
Back door only.

383
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:21,187
There's an old sofa in the basement
and I'll throw you down some blankets.

384
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:25,499
You try to come up those stairs,
and I'm gonna call the police on you.

385
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:26,865
I swear I will.

386
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,845
West fucking Baltimore is on vacation.

387
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,455
No crews slinging in the low-rises,
the towers.

388
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:00,034
What the fuck?

389
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,919
-Who's playing who?
-West against East.

390
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,783
-Baltimore?
-The projects, man.

391
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,252
The bragging rights to the projects.

392
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,794
The projects got a ball team?

393
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:42,278
How long you been working at Orlando's?

394
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,507
-Four, five months.
-You like it?

395
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:47,846
-Pays the rent.
-You must see a lot there, I imagine.

396
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,941
What do you mean?

397
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,749
There's a lot of players there.
A lot of game being played.

398
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,154
I know nothing about that,
I just work for tips.

399
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:56,317
-For tips?
-Tips, drinks.

400
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,885
You know, I'm just a b-girl.
I don't mess with nothing beyond that.

401
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:03,194
Some of the girls in there,
they're into drugs and whatnot.

402
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,826
And some of them turn tricks
in the rooms upstairs but...

403
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,837
I mostly just stay at the bar.

404
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:10,834
Miss Ennis, it's rare
when we ask somebody...

405
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,843
to come on downtown with us
and we don't have a charge on them.

406
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,004
We don't tell them
what we're gonna talk about.

407
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:17,808
And they come along without complaining.

408
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:20,611
-That hardly ever happens.
-Rarely, if ever.

409
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:24,812
-I figure you got your reasons.
-The crew that runs Orlando's...

410
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,447
they've dropped about a dozen
bodies over the last year.

411
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,083
And they're running the drugs
in every housing project...

412
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:32,492
west of the Martin Luther King.

413
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:35,655
I don't know anything about that.
I just work for tips.

414
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:38,098
But now you do know,
because we're telling you.

415
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,568
You know a girl named Keisha Michaels?

416
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,032
-She dances with me.
-How's she doing?

417
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,903
All right, I guess.

418
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,105
Will you excuse us a moment?

419
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,922
-So, what do you think?
-I think she's a sweetheart.

420
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:07,396
I think if we push her hard, she'll tumble.
You want to show her the pictures?

421
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,793
I want to do better than that.

422
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,383
Come on, man, play defense.

423
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,448
-Let's go!
-"D" up, B.

424
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,852
-Who is he?
-That's Marcus Rivera, right there, man.

425
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:41,489
He out of Lake Clifton.
That nigger played in ltaly and shit.

426
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,397
Slim. What's up, man?

427
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,028
You got to go all the way
to Europe to get you a ringer?

428
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,039
No, he home now.

429
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:53,309
But I see you pulling boys
out the junior colleges.

430
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,276
He from Eastside, went to Dunbar.

431
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,745
What's up, playboy?
How come you wearing that suit?

432
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:01,113
It's 85 fucking degrees out here
and you trying to be like Pat Riley.

433
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:03,083
Look the part, be the part, motherfucker.

434
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,519
You walking around with
a fake fucking clipboard.

435
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,090
You can't even read a playbook.

436
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,318
Be for real. Bunch of bitches.

437
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,604
-Let's go.
-That was nice.

438
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,133
That boy was talking to God, right?

439
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:31,009
Ain't you all on the clock?

440
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,976
-Ain't you?
-We on break.

441
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:37,345
Then we on a break, too.
What's up with this game?

442
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:39,979
Just something we do every year,
you know?

443
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,922
Eastside versus Westside niggers.

444
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,120
Loser got to throw a big-ass party
at Druid Hill next weekend.

445
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,255
-Who's favored?
-Eastside won the last two years.

446
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,625
My boys.

447
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:55,796
Found nude Monday morning, in a Dumpster
off Reisterstown road, above Northern.

448
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,875
Toxicology is positive
for heroin and cocaine.

449
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,215
-In a Dumpster?
-Rolled up in a rug.

450
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,611
She overdosed and whoever
was with her didn't do shit...

451
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,243
but roll her up and throw her away.

452
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,582
Because that's how they do.

453
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,817
Positive for semen in vaginal,
anal and oral cavities.

454
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,093
Three different blood types, all secretors.

455
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,019
They fucked her and threw her away.

456
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,157
The only reason we knew who she was,
or what she was about...

457
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,201
or what she might mean
to someone like you...

458
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:27,634
is because we've been
keeping an eye on the people...

459
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,865
who run Orlando's for some time now.

460
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,999
We got ways of knowing
what they're saying...

461
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:33,098
what they're thinking.

462
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,905
You know what they said about this one?

463
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:38,743
That the stupid bitch didn't know how good
the snort was at Little Man's party.

464
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,340
That it was her own fault.
That's how they do it.

465
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,750
They use people,
and when they throw them away...

466
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:46,015
they find a way to say it ain't on them.

467
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:49,615
Lying motherfucker.
He said they took her to a hospital.

468
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,344
Now, get back on "D."

469
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,345
Check out Avon. He's freaking.

470
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,415
Shit, man, we got to win this one.

471
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,411
I think Avon's here.

472
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:19,020
-Where?
-Like I know what he looks like?

473
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,387
He's a black guy rooting for Westside.

474
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:34,530
We might have a visual on Avon.
Street ball game up at Cloverdale.

475
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,574
-Where's Greggs and Freamon?
-Pressing the stripper they picked up.

476
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,710
You and Carver stay on the radio.

477
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,808
-We should follow him.
-Why?

478
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:52,955
He ain't gonna touch drugs or money
anywhere you can see him, Lieutenant.

479
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:57,391
In Narcotics we follow guys.
We do it well, we make cases on it.

480
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,361
Mount up.

481
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:14,769
We been on this guy three months.
Don't you even want to get a look at him?

482
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,871
I wouldn't know Avon Barksdale
if I fell over him in the street.

483
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,210
The thing is, I don't need to.

484
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:21,876
We get him by voice alone
or we don't get him.

485
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,323
Yeah, baby!

486
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,358
Half-time.

487
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:35,328
You got yourself a fine ringer.

488
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:38,026
It's not your year,
you know what I'm talking about?

489
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,332
-It look that way, but you never know.
-I know, man, we up 1 2.

490
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,338
Yeah, you is, but...

491
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,800
I got a proposition for you.

492
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:49,243
-Okay.
-Double down?

493
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,814
Let's give this wager a clean six figures.

494
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,685
You serious?
I don't give a fuck. It's your money.

495
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:59,153
You can waste it if you want,
you know what I'm talking about?

496
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,723
-Anyone got him?
-64-Charlie to central K.

497
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:08,820
1 2-10.

498
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,389
12-10.

499
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,260
1 2-10.

500
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,165
You have him?

501
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,904
Lieutenant, I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

502
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,821
Got him marked.
On the sideline, red shirt, white visor.

503
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,329
I think he's coaching or something.

504
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:17,261
Who this fucking midget?

505
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,014
Get that midget out of here, B.

506
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,760
-Why you holler at me?
-Man, we getting down to it.

507
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:54,360
-I get to you when I get to you.
-That's it, we're on the stash.

508
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:57,733
We are?

509
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,711
How can you put that down
when Sydnor wasn't on the roof?

510
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,185
Yes, he was.

511
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:14,620
No, he's not, he's with Daniels.

512
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:16,620
No, he isn't.

513
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,704
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Ref, what the fuck?

514
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,456
What the fuck?

515
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,634
Ref, what the fuck?

516
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,969
The boy was fouled. Clear, straight up!

517
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,369
How you going to not call that?

518
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:08,972
If you want, I can put time
back on the clock and replay it.

519
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,048
You talking about a do-over?
Talking about a fucking do-over?

520
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,777
That's not how the game is played!
You can't do that!

521
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,445
Believe this shit?
Nigger talking about doing it again.

522
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:21,786
-I don't want any trouble, okay?
-Ain't going to be no trouble over no ball.

523
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,851
Man, you supposed to be the ref, right?

524
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,420
Why don't you stand up
for your fucking self? You pussy.

525
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,992
You can't let any old motherfucking nigger
get in your face, you understand?

526
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,795
Now, walk away.

527
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,773
Turn around and walk the fuck away.

528
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,103
Ignorant motherfucker.

529
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,443
-We cool?
-Yeah, we cool, baby.

530
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,417
You tell your people to come to the park,
Saturday at noon.

531
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,751
Of course you come
on the Westside again, without a ball...

532
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,983
I'm gonna light your ass up.

533
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,966
-D'Angelo?
-You know him?

534
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:05,466
At this point, it feels like I do.

535
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,900
We sort of moved in together.

536
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,843
He seemed like he was different.

537
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,551
-I have to quit the club.
-Yes, you do. But not just yet.

538
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,289
We need your help.
Which is why we came to you.

539
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,086
-I don't know what else--
-Keisha was not the first.

540
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:33,653
Unless somebody steps up a little bit,
she's not going to be the last neither.

541
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,296
You like that one?

542
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,337
Why don't you keep it?

543
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,643
Thank you.

544
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,288
-He's getting into a black Ford Excursion.
-Copy that.

545
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,526
He's pulling out, north on Collington.

546
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:02,992
He's pulling out, north on Collington.

547
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,734
11-71.

548
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:21,038
You got the parallel on the north,
I got him on the south.

549
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,106
1 1-71, I got him.
Looks like he's going east on Oliver.

550
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:44,297
He just parked. East of Oliver.

551
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,700
1 2-10, you keep the eyeball.

552
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:51,740
1 1-71, take up a position on Federal,
west of Montford.

553
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,776
I'm coming up from the south.

554
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,175
1 1-71, I copy that.

555
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,249
He's just sitting there.

556
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,908
-He's doubling back.
-Copy.

557
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:37,146
He's south on Montford.

558
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:55,605
He jumped the light at Preston and Milton
and is south on Milton.

559
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,884
Be advised that he didn't make it to Chase.

560
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,553
1 1-71, what's your status?

561
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,116
He couldn't have gone past us.

562
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:17,720
11-71, nothing on this side.

563
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:24,033
Must have went to ground.

564
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:32,599
All right, hold your positions.
I'll take a look.

565
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,475
-He called again, same pay phone.
-Same voice?

566
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:09,670
It was the main stash house, it's got to be.
The pattern fits.

567
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,271
-Who took the call at the projects?
-Who knows?

568
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:13,679
There was no one on the roof.

569
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,878
Sydnor was off with Daniels,
chasing Avon in the street.

570
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,713
We had a good day, too.

571
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,053
Kima turned one of the dancers
over at Avon's club.

572
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,423
The one who's fucking D'Angelo.

573
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,695
This guy's good.
We threw everything we had at him.

574
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:02,732
You know what they say,
stupid criminals make stupid cops.

575
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:03,061
You know what they say,
stupid criminals make stupid cops.

576
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:06,099
I'm proud to be chasing this guy.

577
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:10,595
We got four front companies so far,
buying up all kinds of shit.

578
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,505
A club, an apartment building,
a funeral home...

579
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,603
and a lot of real estate on the west side
of downtown by the Howard Street corridor.

580
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,807
Shop fronts and warehouses.

581
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,714
-Barksdale's name on it?
-Fronts, mostly. Relatives, some.

582
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,686
Mind if I have a seat?

583
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,058
He's had the projects for more than a year
and it's a money factory.

584
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,689
We popped Wee-Bey coming out
the other day with $22,000.

585
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,893
The boys talking on the wire
were saying it wasn't much of a loss.

586
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,196
$22,000?

587
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:42,999
That's just from one morning
from the towers and the pit.

588
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:45,768
Add the avenue corners,
you're probably up near $30,000.

589
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,607
Another take for the evening, $60,000.

590
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:53,943
-A day?
-That's $25 million a year, conservatively.

591
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,942
You take out 20%
for running expenses and spillage...

592
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:00,614
and you are still clearing
$1 million a month.

593
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:04,458
-So, where's it all go?
-He shows no flash.

594
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,592
He's got no house, no car in his name...

595
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:10,757
no jewelry, no clothes.

596
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:13,665
Just front companies and the property.

597
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:16,797
And political contributions.

598
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,674
$75,000 the last month alone...

599
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,837
all from his front companies
or their listed officers.

600
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,211
And that's just at a quick glance.

601
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,944
I'm just totaling up the legal contributions.

602
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:33,216
You've got the likes of Damien Price,
aide to a state senator...

603
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,315
driving out $20,000 in cash
from the projects...

604
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,326
whenever he feels it.

605
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,623
I know you don't want
to hear this, Lieutenant...

606
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,426
but the money is real and it's everywhere.

607
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,400
And more than the drugs,
it's the money that matters.

608
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:53,709
I ain't fucked nobody else
if that's what you thinking.

609
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,943
All right, I mean, fuck it.
If you want to go, then go!

610
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,643
But you could give me a goddamn reason.

611
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,183
-What do I look like to you?
-What you mean?

612
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:14,960
-What do I look like to you?
-You look like a girl, a woman...

613
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,465
a beautiful woman, you're fine, what?

614
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,065
I don't look like trash to you?

615
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,834
Baby, this ain't about what you do.

616
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,465
I don't look like something
you could roll up in a rug...

617
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:28,441
and throw in the trash?

618
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,980
Shardene.

619
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,886
Lieutenant, you paged us?
We were almost home.

620
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,421
Sit.

621
00:47:58,074 --> 00:48:00,941
-Yeah? Checked my count again, yo.
-How bad?

622
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,342
Not too bad, man.

623
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:08,308
-We got hit about $22,000.
-$22,000? That's all?

624
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,249
All right.

625
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,657
I got towers two, three, five and six...

626
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,962
and another one labeled "P" for the pit.

627
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,698
Where's one and four? It's on the wire
that we took them for $22,000.

628
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,241
You shitheads turned in $15,000.
Where's the rest?

629
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:37,302
-Lieutenant, we ain't got--
-You have till roll call tomorrow...

630
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,440
to crawl back to whatever rock
you hid it under.

631
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,519
It comes back and it goes to ECU.

632
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:46,119
This doesn't happen.

633
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,825
Not with me. Not with my unit.

634
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:04,231
I wouldn't steal and not tell you about it.

635
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,730
This some of Avon's shit.

636
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:31,833
You got Avon Barksdale chasing
your ass all around town...

637
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,529
and you still find time to take his shit.

638
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,401
-It's your shit now.
-What I want with that?

639
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,737
What anybody want with that, man?

640
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,607
-How much you asking?
-We free.

641
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:44,813
Free?

642
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:50,243
I'm saying, I got a little proposition for you.

643
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,721
Proposition is,
you get four G-packs for free...

644
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:57,156
you give me some better idea
on how I can reach Avon.

645
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,994
-How to contact him?
-You all just had a game, right?

646
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:05,095
-How you get a hold of him to parley?
-We talk now and then.

647
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,825
I page his ass.

648
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:09,362
Okay.

649
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,541
That all you need?

650
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,906
-A number?
-I make do with it.

651
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,411
And a code for one of his peoples.

652
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,408
What Wee-Bey use, 07?

653
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:24,752
07.

654
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:31,524
What makes you think
I ain't gonna take this off your hands...

655
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,095
and throw your ass up outta here?

656
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:37,496
Come on, man, Avon goes down,
the projects be open market again, right?

657
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,101
Let me understand.

658
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,105
Avon loses $100,000 to me on a bet...

659
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,205
then you bring me some of his shit...

660
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,438
so that I can put
your predatory self on his ass.

661
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,277
Not his day, is it?

662
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,790
Fuck.

663
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:32,882
Fuck it.

664
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,928
-Where was it?
-The wheel well.

665
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:42,327
You remember when the bag broke?

666
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:47,229
Think Daniels will believe it?

667
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,268
Would you?

668
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:54,973
You didn't believe me.

669
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:57,609
I'm sorry.

670
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,073
Savino late, man.

671
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,777
I'm ready to make this money-run,
get the fuck out here.

672
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,548
-You tired?
-I'm tired, man, I'm hungry.

673
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,953
Shit, me too.
Want something to eat from the diner?

674
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:10,548
Yeah, you going over there?
Get me a cheese steak, man.

675
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,958
-You hungry, too?
-Yeah, I could do a burger.

676
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:14,051
All right.

677
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:16,825
-Let me get onions on that, man.
-I got you.

678
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:20,597
You organizing it right?

679
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:24,139
You got my $50s with my $50s,
and my $100s with my $100s?

680
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,737
All right, ladies, good night.

681
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,642
I see you all tomorrow, on time, you hear?

682
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,933
Count this money, baby.

683
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:05,939
-What the fuck?
-Who's that?

684
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,477
Wee-Bey swinging me an emergency call.

685
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,432
Fuck.

686
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,535
Bey?

687
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,238
91 1 call.

688
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,985
No. We got rules, right?

689
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,213
Fuck.

690
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,341
They had cheese fries, baby. I got you some.

691
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:11,567
Avon, stay down, man. I got you covered.

692
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:22,567
