1
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:31,726
This is the second time this week...

2
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:34,703
I had to pay for a sitter
'cause he was workin' late.

3
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:37,502
With all that money he make,
you can afford it.

4
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:51,986
Lord.

5
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:02,196
What's up, Bubs?

6
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:05,324
Hey.

7
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:09,373
There you go.

8
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,201
-What you got?
-I got some starters.

9
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:10,553
My fault, A.

10
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:14,623
-Should've never left you alone, homie.
-No, shit.

11
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:17,062
Man, you ain't pull up when you did,
I'm gone.

12
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:20,934
Listen, what I want to know is how
we fucking come back on this cocksucker?

13
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:23,268
We don't. Not now.

14
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:24,769
You feel me?

15
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,674
Listen, Stringer,
your advice was good advice...

16
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:30,372
you know what I'm saying?
I wanna let you know that.

17
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,813
What I want you to do now
is put the word out there.

18
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:36,011
I want you to let him know
we willing to squash this, if he is.

19
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,747
And then what the fuck if he ain't?

20
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:42,315
No, this nigger live in the town, too.
He gonna listen, if we parley.

21
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:45,218
And then when he creep out
of his hole, and shit.

22
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,318
-Boom.
-Okay.

23
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,694
-Smoke him.
-Say no more, got you.

24
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,926
-Put that out there, yo.
-All right.

25
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:56,707
About them police, though,
they was on your ass after the game?

26
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,699
Yeah, man, it was like two cars.

27
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:03,045
See, if they on you, then they got a name.

28
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:05,843
If they got a name,
then they know you got no license.

29
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,010
But they don't want no traffic charges,
you know what I'm saying?

30
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,587
They don't want no humble shit.

31
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:13,179
I think they was trying
to see where I might go.

32
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,316
Where the fuck was you
gonna take their asses?

33
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:18,623
I was taking them to the barbershop.
I was going to get a haircut.

34
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:20,128
Get a fade?

35
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:24,398
I know, B, but these motherfuckers
are on us. Fuck.

36
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:27,938
They always have been on us,
we just gotta be careful.

37
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:31,266
You not been talking on any phones.

38
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,470
And you not been touching any drugs.

39
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:36,375
And from now on,
you are not doing the money runs.

40
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,846
Me and Bey, we gonna take care
of that shit...

41
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,815
until this whole thing cool off.

42
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:43,978
-Let me get that pager.
-What's up, you serious?

43
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:47,216
Serious. I'm gonna get you
a New York supply number only.

44
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,516
Any of these motherfucking local cats...

45
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:52,061
wanna talk to you, they gotta talk to me.

46
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,362
We gotta build a wall around you, B.

47
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,471
Another month on a fresh phone?

48
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,634
They ripped out the pay phones
in the low-rises.

49
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:08,405
Now they're walking a block or two.

50
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:10,742
How much longer
until you bring this case in?

51
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:13,783
The quicker you can the better
for everybody. Yourself included.

52
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,478
Look at this.
Judge Gwynn sends his regrets.

53
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:19,215
He can't make lunch.
Like I suddenly got the plague.

54
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:21,314
There's your new phone. 30 days.

55
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:24,356
A few weeks ago, when Burrell
wanted to take down the wire...

56
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:26,327
you were the one breaking off on his ass.

57
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,624
Jimmy, there's a lady here.

58
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:30,292
Rhonda talks more trash than both of us,
Your Honor.

59
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:33,632
I have never been
anything other than ladylike, Your Honor.

60
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:37,467
Detective McNulty is going out of his way
to insult an officer of the court.

61
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:40,635
-McNulty, I hold you in contempt.
-Who doesn't?

62
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:44,809
What's with him?

63
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:46,507
-You haven't heard?
-No.

64
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:53,085
-What's wrong with the picture?
-Don't know.

65
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:57,692
-Phelan isn't in it.
-What, he's up for election?

66
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,660
I thought judges had 15-year terms.

67
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:02,324
They do, but Phelan was named
to finish Halpern's term...

68
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,764
which only had two years left.

69
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,733
So he has to run on his own in the primary.

70
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:07,326
What, he's not on the ticket?

71
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:08,837
Why the fuck not?

72
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:11,775
Maybe it's the company he keeps.

73
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:14,001
Fuck.

74
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,874
No, see, you ain't thinking about
how much room the baby gonna need.

75
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:20,209
Specially when he get to growing...

76
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,715
'cause there are things we got to have.

77
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,482
Like a real crib, a play desk...

78
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:28,615
and you know, he got to have
one of them Little Tikes cars.

79
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,956
I'm not saying your place
ain't nice enough...

80
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,597
'cause for you, it do just fine,
but if we gonna be a family...

81
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,258
'cause for you, it do just fine,
but if we gonna be a family...

82
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:38,229
we need at least one more room, if not two.

83
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:42,738
So you add the bedroom set,
a nice bedroom set like the one they got...

84
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,901
down at that baby store on Howard Street,
and that's a room right there.

85
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,846
And I think we might
get some better furniture...

86
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:52,415
and put your stuff in the other bedroom...

87
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,217
Iike it was a den...

88
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:56,377
'cause the sofa you got seen better days...

89
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,250
I think you know that much.

90
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:03,993
Dee, where you goin' at?

91
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:08,359
I told you I need money
for the new bedroom set. Dee!

92
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:11,262
-Why you holler at me?
-Yo, man, we getting down to it.

93
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,359
I get to you when I get to you.

94
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:15,801
That's the main stash house.

95
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:17,296
Say what?

96
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:21,003
The incoming call is the guy who runs
the main stash for Barksdale's people.

97
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:22,773
-Who is he?
-We don't know.

98
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,474
So, y'all are just guessing
he's on the stash, right?

99
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,914
No, he's on it.

100
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:30,350
Lester was checking the logs
when he picked up the pattern.

101
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,786
Every time they get down
to the ends on a package...

102
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,824
somebody in the tower
hits that pager number.

103
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:37,155
Then, within a half-hour
every fucking time...

104
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:40,924
a call comes back to the tower pay phone
from that number in Pimlico.

105
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:42,122
Which is?

106
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:45,997
It's a pay phone at a Mondo Mart
in Reisterstown on Cold Spring Lane.

107
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:48,099
You see it now?

108
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:56,707
When the supply gets low,
they page this mope...

109
00:07:56,947 --> 00:08:01,577
who always calls back from a pay phone
way the fuck out in north-west.

110
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
Same phone, same pattern.

111
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:06,889
So y'all think that
he's taking the re-up order...

112
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:09,824
and that the stash is somewhere
near the Mondo Mart, right?

113
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:13,761
-You are on it, Detective Sydnor.
-Okay, so what do you do with this?

114
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:15,331
What do we do?

115
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,069
We're gonna be sittin'
on that phone in Pimlico...

116
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:22,264
all day and night
waitin' on Mr. Mondo Mart.

117
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,341
-Herc, too.
-Herc's out this whole week.

118
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,841
-In-service training.
-That's too bad.

119
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:32,011
So, instead of three eight-hour shifts,
you two are gonna have to pull 1 2 hours.

120
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:35,509
Just fucking kill me now.

121
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,147
-Heard from Omar?
-Nope.

122
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:42,892
I'm gonna go try to scare him up.
Where you gonna be?

123
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,320
Everyone on the wire keeps talking about...

124
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,863
how this kid's all tore up
about the dead stickup boy.

125
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,092
-I'm gonna see for myself.
-All right.

126
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:53,229
-You need us, we're on the radio.
-Okay.

127
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,865
Hey, what up, man?

128
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:34,803
This first time,
I can go four ounces of rock...

129
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:38,814
but hey, if the shit is right,
then next time I can step that up.

130
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,917
Almost ain't worth it for four.

131
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,551
Just this first go-round.

132
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:46,384
You do right by me,
I'll turn around and come back on it.

133
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,185
Where your money at, man?

134
00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:59,063
We good.

135
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:03,636
So, where the shit at?

136
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,887
Ain't nobody been there but you.
Nobody came in my house but you.

137
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,083
Everybody.

138
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:59,754
Nobody but you. You're the only person
that came in my house.

139
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,966
So, what you got goin' for you?

140
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,063
Ain't got nothing left, burnt it away.

141
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,132
Family?

142
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,439
Mother dead. Father, who the fuck know.

143
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,465
Brothers, sisters?

144
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:17,674
A sister, she lets me stay in the basement...

145
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:20,076
but she lock the door so I can't go upstairs.

146
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:22,243
About the best she can do for me.

147
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,677
Got a kid, a son.

148
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,280
Imagine me bringing life into the world.

149
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:29,586
-What's his name?
-Keyshawn.

150
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:34,322
His mother took him up Jersey way,
said I wasn't fit to be with the boy.

151
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,262
-I didn't disagree.
-Well...

152
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:40,036
at least you got your health.

153
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:42,437
Here's to health.

154
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:47,634
I got the bug.

155
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,043
Had it since '94.

156
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,918
Gave that shit to my old lady.

157
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:58,411
Worried about passing it on to my baby girl.

158
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:01,349
No, I was spared that at least.

159
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,787
Damn, how do you carry it?

160
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:09,194
-You ask her forgiveness?
-Of course.

161
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:13,669
-What she say?
-What she needed to say.

162
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:16,963
Look, forgiveness from other folks is good...

163
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:20,201
but ain't nothing but words
coming at you from outside.

164
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,144
You wanna kick this shit,
you got to forgive your own self.

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,111
Love yourself some, brother.

166
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:34,452
And then drag your sorry ass
to some meetings.

167
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:37,049
-Meetings?
-What the fuck you wanna hear?

168
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:39,755
That you're strong enough
to do this by yourself?

169
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,023
Getting clean's the easy part.

170
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,731
Now comes life.

171
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:51,640
It's this one here with the orange cord
coming out of the back.

172
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,733
They're pirating juice from the other house.

173
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:57,075
You fucking gotta be kidding me.
Now I'm policing for BGE?

174
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:01,143
They're not there yet,
but when this kid here posts, snatch him up.

175
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,381
Park our asses outside this shit-hole and
wait for some little project yo to raise up?

176
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,753
Mrs. McNulty raised no fools.

177
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,516
Four Faidley's crabcakes in the bag...

178
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:12,322
24 Dutch beers in the box.

179
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,598
Faidley's? You all right, McNulty.

180
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:15,087
Faidley's? You all right, McNulty.

181
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:19,127
I don't care what all them
other fucks downtown say about you.

182
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,294
1 1-35, what's up?

183
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:23,839
Our friend wants to meet. Same spot.

184
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:27,741
-Copy that, 15 minutes.
-What's the deal with the yo-boy?

185
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:30,643
-What'd he do?
-Stumbled into my world.

186
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:02,941
-Five minutes, come on.
-I have to go.

187
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,877
-Shardene.
-I said, I have to go.

188
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,416
-I can't have five minutes?
-No, not right now.

189
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:12,716
Fuck!

190
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:20,661
How close did you get?

191
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:24,962
Y'all be chalking that nigger if Wee Bey
ain't pop up at the last second like....

192
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,933
Remember when we last talked?

193
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:29,469
You were gonna lay back,
let us work our case.

194
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:31,268
I said, I'd do what I can.

195
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:35,236
Still, I thought I might let y'all know
Avon's people got in contact...

196
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:37,643
talking about they want to end the beef.

197
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:41,309
-They offered me some kind of amnesty.
-Amnesty?

198
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:45,320
Look, I chill out on the manhunt
and stop hitting them in the head...

199
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:48,289
for their product,
they gonna call off the bounty.

200
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:50,189
Take the truce, Omar.

201
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:52,990
I might, if they ain't trying to play me.

202
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:56,827
-They said they want to parley on it.
-Parley?

203
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:01,527
Look, I don't know, man, but right now
I need some assistance from y'all.

204
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:15,748
Yo, son, I go to the ER,
and word get back to Avon...

205
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:19,618
you know he gonna have his henchmen
waiting in the parking lot for me.

206
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:27,557
Look, I know y'all friendly
with a couple of doctors, right? Right?

207
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,852
He says he can buy weight.
Says he runs with some decent-size locals.

208
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:54,581
-Like who?
-Avon, something.... Barksdale.

209
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:56,891
Avon Barksdale?

210
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:01,656
Run it through the DECS and HIDA.
See what comes back.

211
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,903
I'm gonna check around,
see if anybody's working...

212
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,302
these names you gave us.

213
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,874
If you full of shit, pal,
I'm gonna know it quick.

214
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:14,068
But what happens to me
while you checking?

215
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:16,577
Eager Street. City jail, motherfucker.

216
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:24,078
Blue came home last week.
I ain't seen him since.

217
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:26,444
Yeah.

218
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,749
I can't believe it.

219
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,109
-Damn, Carv, you's triflin'.
-Yeah, I admit it, I'm disgusting.

220
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,279
Cheese puffs and fucking Ring-Dings?

221
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:58,547
Yeah.

222
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,080
-Yeah.
-The big fuck from the high-rise...

223
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:31,450
-what's his name?
-Little Man.

224
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:34,023
-Yeah, him.
-All right.

225
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:46,561
-Yo.
-Be ready, we're on it.

226
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,873
Look at this pretty motherfucker.

227
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:05,484
Too fucked up to drive home, McNulty?

228
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:17,795
Hey, Bunk.

229
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:27,139
Kid gave us a murder.
More than that, he's put in Stringer Bell.

230
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:28,771
Yeah?

231
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:32,075
Picks out Wee-Bey, Bird
and Stinkum from photo arrays.

232
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:33,740
Puts them all up at the Greek's...

233
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,616
the night they grab up Omar's boy, Brandon.
Puts Bell in the truck, too.

234
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:40,988
Says, "Stringer told me
to point out the stickup boy."

235
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:45,051
-Jeez, what do you have over him?
-Not a fucking thing.

236
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,759
Kid was ready, barely had to push him.

237
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,397
-Whose case?
-Norris's.

238
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:54,299
-How old?
-16.

239
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:57,696
Lives in a shit-hole vacant over on Argyle.

240
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:00,641
When I grab him up,
I swear he's halfway into a nod.

241
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:01,836
Using?

242
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,849
When they kill the stickup boy
the fuckers dump the body in the alley...

243
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,408
behind where this kid and all the other
low-rise hoppers lay their heads.

244
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,817
Can you imagine?

245
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:14,748
All he can think about.

246
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:17,285
You tell him he's gonna have to testify?

247
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:21,194
Not yet, we'll get there.
Problem is, what do we do with him now?

248
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:40,880
-Yeah.
-Big boy picking up.

249
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:42,843
Okay.

250
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:49,288
-You holler at me, right?
-Where you at, man? We on our way down.

251
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:51,326
First thing tomorrow, man.

252
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,061
-Yeah?
-It's him, stay on it.

253
00:19:58,168 --> 00:19:59,192
All right.

254
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,288
I didn't do nothing, man, get me outta here.

255
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,903
The 2-2, grounded slowly towards third,
and it gets through at the last moment.

256
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,663
Where my phone call at?

257
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,898
Suzuki's at the plate, here's the pitch.

258
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:45,713
Line drive, up the middle,
a base hit for Suzuki.

259
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:50,081
Suzuki's very patient at the plate.

260
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,444
Yeah, man, it's me.

261
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,620
Guess who's up in here.

262
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,985
Pimpin'-ass Orlando, from the club.

263
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,123
Yeah. Courtside.

264
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:33,019
-So, how long you been slingin'?
-Since I was, maybe, 1 2.

265
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:36,889
And how long were you
with Barksdale's crew in the low-rises?

266
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,401
With D'Angelo? Not long.

267
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:44,069
He came down from the towers
at the beginning of the summer.

268
00:21:44,174 --> 00:21:46,074
Before that I worked for Ronnie Mo.

269
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:49,407
D'Angelo ever talk to you
about what happened in the 221 building...

270
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,104
with Pooh getting shot?

271
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:54,112
How about anything else like that?

272
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,380
-Like what?
-Killings, murders.

273
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:03,686
He say anything about a girl getting shot
in an apartment up on the Eastside?

274
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,184
He--

275
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:12,162
No, Dee, he was good to me. He all right.

276
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:15,971
But D'Angelo, he was who you called
that night when you saw...

277
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:18,006
the stickup boy at the Greek's, right?

278
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,871
Yeah, but he didn't go up there.

279
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,967
It was mostly those tower boys.

280
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:25,172
And Stringer.
You said Stringer was in the truck.

281
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:28,842
He called you over,
asked you to point out the stickup boy.

282
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:37,422
All of it corroborated by the beeper logs...

283
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,052
and the pen registers
from the project pay phones.

284
00:22:40,163 --> 00:22:43,030
Stinkum's dead.
We've already got Bird for the Gant killing.

285
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:45,192
-This ties them all in.
-D'Angelo, too.

286
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:47,667
Maybe, but since he didn't show
at the Greek's...

287
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:50,865
he tells the jury
he didn't see the murder coming.

288
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:52,373
It's enough to charge him, anyway.

289
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:53,305
Parents?

290
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,503
Alcoholic mother.
In the wind, no fixed address.

291
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:57,944
Says he's got a grandmother
on the Eastern Shore...

292
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,379
but he hasn't seen her in years.

293
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:01,882
-How about a hotel room?
-On whose dime?

294
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:05,148
No way the Deputy approves the manpower
to stash a 16-year-old...

295
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:06,586
much less the room service.

296
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,281
McNulty, Line 2.

297
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:20,993
How about you run this up to front office?
See if the state's attorney will kick in.

298
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,271
He's a kid, Cedric.

299
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:26,636
Even if we clear the money,
do you really wanna put a juvenile...

300
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:29,610
in a hotel for six months
waiting on a trial date?

301
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:33,477
I think you all need to get
with Grandma down on the shore.

302
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,376
Now? She's doing this right now?

303
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:41,520
They don't have to set a hearing date
or something like that?

304
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,659
Christ, yeah, okay. Yeah.

305
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,260
I fuckin' need a fuckin' lawyer.

306
00:23:57,807 --> 00:23:58,967
What?

307
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:02,202
Still, you can see that
they got the security bars...

308
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:03,840
and look there.

309
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:08,746
Cameras that see over the yard
out to the street.

310
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:12,319
And I checked with Verizon,
there's no phone service at that address.

311
00:24:12,422 --> 00:24:14,151
That's a telltale right there.

312
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:16,817
So what? We try to write a warrant
for this place, right?

313
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:17,893
Right?

314
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:31,404
-What are you seeing?
-No pattern, really.

315
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:33,772
Except this cluster of old storefronts...

316
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:36,209
and warehouses
on the west side of downtown.

317
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:39,543
Around Paca, Utah, Howard Street, mostly.

318
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:42,379
-Storefronts?
-Vacants, usually.

319
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,812
Three different holding companies.

320
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:48,116
-Detective Pryzbylewski.
-What?

321
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:51,625
You have a gift for the paper trail.

322
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,891
Tomorrow calls for some street work,
though. Are you street ready?

323
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:05,003
You know the Lieutenant has me in-office.
I don't have my gun until the grand jury.

324
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:07,599
-You won't need one.
-On the street? No gun?

325
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,508
No gun. Not for this.

326
00:25:12,615 --> 00:25:15,448
Furthermore, Mr. McNulty,
having utilized his sons...

327
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:19,511
in an act of police work
involving a criminal suspect...

328
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:23,422
actually lost track of them
in a crowded municipal market.

329
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:26,060
This is simply unacceptable, Your Honor.

330
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:29,154
Be that as it may,
an emergency ex parte order...

331
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:31,563
is an extraordinary request, Mr. Palmer.

332
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:35,695
You actually want me to limit visitations
to afternoons only, and you want...

333
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:38,433
Mrs. McNulty present at all visitations?
Come on.

334
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,032
It is not a single lapse, Judge.

335
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:45,581
Mr. McNulty has time and again
failed to properly care for the children...

336
00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:47,274
when they're in his custody.

337
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:51,547
I have a list of recent events, Your Honor,
that justify an order.

338
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:55,055
Ms. Pearlman, you have a response
you'd like to offer up here?

339
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:57,384
Nope.

340
00:25:58,228 --> 00:25:59,422
Nothing?

341
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,700
If this were possession with intent,
I'd be a prosecutor with a plan.

342
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:10,102
But a domestic order hearing?
Your Honor, I'm officially clueless.

343
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:14,402
In fact, as an employee of the state,
I should not actually be here.

344
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:17,168
All right, listen up, people...

345
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,113
before you have me make a ruling
on an emergency petition...

346
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:22,582
everybody here just needs
to take a deep breath.

347
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,118
Literally, come on.

348
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:28,656
Now, then, is Mr. McNulty capable...

349
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:31,522
of having a civil conversation
with Mrs. McNulty?

350
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:32,921
Yes, Your Honor.

351
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:37,227
And is Mrs. McNulty equally capable
of having a conversation with Mr. McNulty?

352
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:40,592
-Yes.
-Good, then I'm going to lunch.

353
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:43,399
Let's see when I return
if we can't busy this court...

354
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:47,636
with something just a little more engaging
than the problems of the McNultys.

355
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:50,975
Look, the charge is on me.
I understand that, I'll carry that.

356
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,479
But the least our people can do...

357
00:26:52,582 --> 00:26:54,982
is throw down a little something
to pay the bondsman.

358
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:57,348
That's the deed of transfer for the club.

359
00:26:57,453 --> 00:27:00,980
The other thing is a license transfer
application for the liquor board.

360
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,923
They're both backdated
and notarized for last week.

361
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:05,486
What?

362
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:08,723
A front has to be clean.

363
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:13,001
And right now, you ain't that. Sign.

364
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:20,572
I want my bail paid.
You send me a bondsman, I'll sign.

365
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,271
Is that what you want me to tell him?

366
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,847
That I asked you to sign and you wouldn't?

367
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:44,192
You wanted to be in the game, right?

368
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:47,994
Now you're in the game.

369
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,007
Unbelievable. You show up with her?

370
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:54,235
Elena, you went for an emergency ex parte.

371
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:56,369
I grabbed whatever lawyer
was standing around.

372
00:27:56,479 --> 00:28:00,711
She was standing?
Ask her if she wants the pictures back.

373
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:04,309
Let's see, I've got her at the restaurant
with you pulling out her chair.

374
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,151
I've got her at the motel parking lot
with you opening the car door for her...

375
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:10,418
because you're such
a fucking gentleman now.

376
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,426
I can't believe you hired Buckman.

377
00:28:12,528 --> 00:28:14,826
Son of a bitch never made
a case that counted.

378
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:16,990
He caught your cheating ass.

379
00:28:20,436 --> 00:28:22,461
Elena, why are we here?

380
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:26,565
Because you can't have
Sean and Michael around criminals.

381
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:29,804
You can't lose them
in a Baltimore market. That's why.

382
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:31,641
He wasn't a criminal.

383
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:37,075
I know the guy.
It was a game we were playing.

384
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:40,815
It was daylight on a crowded street.
They could've been following AI Capone.

385
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:43,551
It would've been fine.
Look, Elena, these are my sons.

386
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:46,253
I love them. Do you hear, I love them.

387
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:48,353
I'm not gonna let them get hurt.

388
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:53,827
I love you, too.

389
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:57,303
Still do.

390
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:07,314
Does she know
about the detective and the pictures?

391
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:09,851
No, why would I tell her about that?

392
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:13,515
And are the two of you still....

393
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:14,988
No.

394
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,357
Yes.

395
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:24,993
A little.

396
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:37,176
Come on, let's make nice for the judge.

397
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:40,579
Okay.

398
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:50,019
We know we have a month more to go
and we're not gonna let up.

399
00:29:50,393 --> 00:29:53,726
We are going to raise more,
we are going to spend more...

400
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,526
and on Election Day,
we are going to be out there...

401
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:58,930
pushing the vote in every precinct.

402
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:00,629
You ready?

403
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:08,937
Come on, we'll get dinner first.

404
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:11,677
Ain't so hungry.

405
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:14,677
Come on.

406
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:28,293
How much were you using?

407
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:34,801
I'm asking if you're gonna be sick in my car.

408
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:37,670
A cap now and then.

409
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:39,903
You just snorting?

410
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:47,341
You'll be all right in a day or two. Come on.

411
00:30:57,293 --> 00:30:59,124
This nigger coming or what, man?

412
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:02,459
Said he would, if I guaranteed a parley.
And I'm here on it.

413
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:06,357
Of course, he said you would be
paying my fee rather than his own self.

414
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:07,367
Your fee?

415
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,836
I'm doing like one of them
marriage counselors.

416
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:13,375
Charge by the hour to tell some fool
he need to bring some flowers home.

417
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,467
Then charge another hour telling the bitch...

418
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:18,411
she ought to suck some cock
every little once and a while.

419
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:21,039
To keep a marriage strong like that.

420
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:24,116
Speaking of cocksuckers.

421
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:29,652
-Don't believe we met.
-Proposition Joe.

422
00:31:31,594 --> 00:31:34,358
You ever steal from me,
I kill your whole family.

423
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:39,396
All right. You all both here on my guarantee,
so respect that shit and say what you feel.

424
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:41,763
I'm up out of here.

425
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:51,680
I got a man who say he gonna
give you your life back.

426
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,039
Who, Barksdale?

427
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,141
My man say, "Tell that motherfucker that...

428
00:31:56,252 --> 00:31:58,982
"if he can find a way
not to dip in our pockets...

429
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:01,113
"we're gonna call this shit even."

430
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:05,894
You all aced Bailey,
and what you did to my boy?

431
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:10,625
So, y'all think after what you did to Brandon
we supposed to find some even on this?

432
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:14,362
I don't know shit about shit, all right?
I'm just the messenger.

433
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:15,968
Whatever, man.

434
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,573
You know there's dead on both sides, right?

435
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:22,576
And there's gonna be a whole lot more
if this beef keep up.

436
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:26,409
But the truth be told, there be more soldiers
on one half than the other.

437
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:28,210
You know what I'm saying?

438
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,812
Look here, son, you tell Barksdale...

439
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:36,756
that he's been paid back
for what he did to my peoples.

440
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,386
But as for his product,
a man's got to earn a living, you know?

441
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:42,930
I don't know nobody called Barksdale, B.

442
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:48,264
The man I'm talking about can't have
his shit taken like that. That won't do.

443
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:52,734
All right, tell him to throw me
some cash then, and we'll see....

444
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,238
About $5,000 or $10,000.

445
00:32:56,178 --> 00:32:58,514
You know what I mean,
for my retirement, homes.

446
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:02,550
-$5,000 ifyou can keep quiet about it.
-Send my money through Joe, man.

447
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:06,179
You go through Joe,
you're not gonna see $2,000 of that.

448
00:33:06,455 --> 00:33:09,117
-Why don't you tell my man where you at--
-No.

449
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:11,785
We gonna figure
something else out, you hear?

450
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:14,962
I'll be in touch, homes.

451
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:22,070
How careful is Stringer Bell?

452
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:24,332
"I don't know no one named Barksdale."

453
00:33:24,774 --> 00:33:25,832
Shit.

454
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:28,603
Still, we got him tied to the Brandon killing.

455
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:31,271
That can be enough for one day's work.

456
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:42,282
Did what I could for y'all.

457
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,710
You sure, right?

458
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:08,283
Yeah, I spent a summer here
when I was nine.

459
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,080
When was the last time they saw you?

460
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,881
When I was nine.

461
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:20,561
-What's that?
-What?

462
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:22,158
That noise.

463
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:24,497
It's crickets.

464
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,668
-Cricket.
-Crickets.

465
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:37,602
-He try to go in my pockets again?
-This nigger is talking about $5,000, B.

466
00:34:37,713 --> 00:34:39,237
Shit.

467
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:45,847
What's up, baby?

468
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:48,389
Antwon said to bring these up.
You want anything else?

469
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:49,480
No, we cool.

470
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:51,958
I'm saying though,
how we supposed to pay that?

471
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:54,996
He talking about going through Joe,
but I'm like, fuck Joe.

472
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,760
Thank you, you know what I mean?

473
00:34:58,868 --> 00:35:01,701
You look good and your services
are appreciated.

474
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:04,534
Keep them tips,
I hope you making them, baby.

475
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:08,410
Make the motherfucker
come down to the towers...

476
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,672
Make the motherfucker
come down to the towers...

477
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:12,043
to get the rest of his money,
know what I'm saying?

478
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:15,117
If he's stupid enough to come
to the towers, he gonna get got.

479
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:17,708
It's a wrap. How we supposed to pay that?

480
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,947
All right.

481
00:35:24,627 --> 00:35:27,221
Y'all think you can hang, but, look.

482
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:35,064
No, you see, I went to journalism school.

483
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:38,800
All right? Northwestern.
So you all can't stay with me on this....

484
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:42,344
Girl, you talking like
you some crusty old reporter.

485
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:45,436
-Excuse me?
-Bitch, you work at a TV station.

486
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:50,315
It's the same thing, all right?
Look, come on, stop talking.

487
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,284
Here we go.

488
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,488
-Bring it.
-Come on, Kima.

489
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:00,718
I gotta work tomorrow.

490
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:04,923
Candy ass.

491
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:07,328
That's all I have to say.

492
00:36:09,371 --> 00:36:12,238
-Okay, you see?
-I'm with you.

493
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:13,701
All right.

494
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:16,642
Look at Tanya.
And she run a damn art gallery.

495
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:21,111
You see, police in this town ain't about shit.

496
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:26,318
-Guess not.
-Thank you.

497
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:28,785
Can't hold a liquor.

498
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,884
Can't hold a donut.

499
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:38,827
And if you ask me, I guess we...

500
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:41,096
ain't good in bed, either.

501
00:36:41,203 --> 00:36:45,299
Don't go there, Officer. Don't go there.

502
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,840
Kima, how did you know
you wanted to be a cop?

503
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:54,109
I mean, how did you choose that?

504
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:58,585
When you were little,
did you think about it at all, or....

505
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:02,215
Come on, Kima.

506
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:07,055
I remember when I was in the Northeast,
still field-training as a cadet.

507
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:10,227
I didn't know if I was gonna
stick with it or not.

508
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:12,664
And then we got this one call.

509
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:16,528
We chased this purse-snatcher
up into these apartments.

510
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:19,634
I got separated from my FTO.

511
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:21,539
Shit, I ain't even no police yet.

512
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:26,104
You know, I'm just a trainee. And I'm alone.

513
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:32,550
Anyway, I mean,
I don't know how, but I find the guy.

514
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:37,319
So I catch him and I hold on to him
and I manage to get to my radio.

515
00:37:38,661 --> 00:37:41,858
We in the middle of this parking lot
and we're rolling around...

516
00:37:41,964 --> 00:37:45,764
and this motherfucker's
steady kicking my ass trying to get away.

517
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:50,972
I look over and I see these black patents
and these uniform blue pants.

518
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:55,674
I look up and it's Charlie Smoot...

519
00:37:57,546 --> 00:38:01,312
Charlie fucking Smoot.
You know, this guy's a legend.

520
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:05,375
He looks down at me and he smiles,
you know real quiet-like.

521
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:09,082
And he drops his cuffs.
He says, "Here you go, rook."

522
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:13,091
That's all he says.

523
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:15,620
"Here you go, rook."

524
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:20,258
And then he dropped
the bracelets and walked away.

525
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:27,073
I mean, I know you don't like it.

526
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:31,913
But shit, I was proud.

527
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:44,458
God damn.

528
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,307
Lester says we ain't gonna
write a warrant on this place.

529
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:38,244
-How do we not with all this PC?
-We're on the main stash, right?

530
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:39,678
Why would we kick the door in...

531
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:42,273
when all we have to do
is park a van down the street...

532
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:45,251
follow the entire Westside drug supply
in and out of the place?

533
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:48,050
We're gonna start picking up
pieces of Barksdale's world...

534
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:49,522
we never even knew about.

535
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,183
Been hell looking for you people.

536
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:53,693
What the hell's the name
of this unit anyway?

537
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:56,356
Shit, Kima in the house.

538
00:39:56,465 --> 00:40:01,164
What's up, Wig?
State police, CID, out of Pikesville.

539
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,062
Name of Troy Wiggins,
but pay no attention to the man...

540
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:08,871
because he about 90-95% pure bullshit.

541
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:12,608
Kima, she just talk like that
because I had her when she was good.

542
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:15,877
Shit, you the ugly-ass motherfucker
turned me the other way.

543
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:20,387
Shit, all right.
Here's the thing, boys and girls.

544
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:23,517
I'm doing a reverse buy-down
in Arundel, right?

545
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:26,651
And I get this Westside asshole
nibbling on four ounces, right?

546
00:40:26,762 --> 00:40:29,424
-A whole four ounces?
-I know, he ain't much, but...

547
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:31,931
I get him in the boat
and he starts flopping around...

548
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:35,663
saying he can buy weight from some
motherfucker, name of Barksdale.

549
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:39,262
I never heard of no Barksdale.
But I put the name into DECS.

550
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:43,743
And the computer has Avon Barksdale
entered as an active Baltimore city target.

551
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:48,078
So I go down to City Narcotics, and Dawson,
he sends me down here to see y'all.

552
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:50,242
So what's the name of your fish?

553
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,814
Wendell O., as in...

554
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:56,220
oh-shit-l-tried-to-buy
from-a-state-police Blocker.

555
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:59,355
That wouldn't be
Wendell "Orlando" Blocker, would it?

556
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:01,929
Yeah. You on it.

557
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:05,661
Orlando.

558
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,325
They keep that back room locked.

559
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,873
And even if I do get back there
on an errand, then they kind of shut down.

560
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:13,601
They get real quiet.

561
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:15,870
You said you heard one say
something about...

562
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:18,105
making someone come into the towers.

563
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:20,907
-Yeah.
-Which one was talking?

564
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:24,483
He was tall, I think.

565
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:27,054
All right, but who else was there?

566
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:32,754
I don't really see that well
without my glasses.

567
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:34,962
Where are your glasses?

568
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:42,695
You can't see faces without those?

569
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:48,638
You don't wear those while you're working,
do you, darlin'?

570
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:52,202
Would you? I gotta live off drinks and tips.

571
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,445
-No way.
-Why not?

572
00:41:56,552 --> 00:41:59,248
Because a player wouldn't be
the name on the liquor license.

573
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:01,117
He'd have a connect for Barksdale's coke.

574
00:42:01,223 --> 00:42:02,588
He wouldn't walk into state troopers.

575
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:04,886
He got a charge and now
he's talking out his ass.

576
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:08,520
You're never gonna get Avon
or Stringer in the same room as the dope.

577
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:12,657
-We make this case on their voices alone.
-So maybe he can't buy from Barksdale.

578
00:42:12,768 --> 00:42:14,827
Maybe he can only buy
from Savino or Wee-Bey.

579
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:16,165
Fuck him, then.

580
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:20,367
We already got Wee-Bey tied to a murder,
and Savino's the runt of the litter.

581
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:28,015
We can take what Orlando
gives us about the club.

582
00:42:28,116 --> 00:42:30,949
The money laundering, maybe, or the girls.

583
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:34,784
For that kind of cooperation,
I'll drop a few years and call it fair.

584
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:39,124
-Daniels in here?
-Yeah.

585
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:42,595
Call from Deputy Commissioner for you.
You want it in here?

586
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:45,524
No.

587
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:47,625
He doesn't miss much.

588
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:02,540
-I need some help here.
-Come on, Bubs.

589
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:06,018
You got me coming across town
in the middle of a fucked-up workday...

590
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:08,521
just so you can hold $10,
that shit ain't right.

591
00:43:08,624 --> 00:43:10,888
Hold on, I don't need $10, okay?

592
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:13,689
I don't know. I need a place of my own.

593
00:43:14,596 --> 00:43:17,724
All right? Some bed,
some sheets, some clothes.

594
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,960
I definitely need some new clothes.

595
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:23,097
How long you been clean?

596
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:26,237
Three days.

597
00:43:28,443 --> 00:43:30,070
You serious about it?

598
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,411
Who knows?

599
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:39,345
What the fuck am I gonna do
with a clean informant?

600
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:41,149
Did you think about that?

601
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:49,023
All right, I'm on it with you.

602
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:52,791
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

603
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:58,037
What the fuck, give me some love.

604
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,301
Okay, I mean, I think I can get,
you know, a mattress, my own place...

605
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:05,278
everything for like a couple hundred dollars.

606
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:09,040
All right. We'll talk.

607
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:12,887
I gotta be somewhere tonight,
so hit me on my page tomorrow.

608
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:15,717
Tomorrow?

609
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:18,292
I got you.

610
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:26,890
-The cooperator says he can buy weight.
-Not from Barksdale or Bell.

611
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:28,697
How can you be sure?

612
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:32,296
How much dope or coke do you think
gets Avon Barksdale into the room?

613
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:35,399
A kilo? 2 kilos? 20 kilos?

614
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:39,213
We are not going to buy
our way up the ladder here.

615
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:42,875
These people do not touch the drugs.
They don't go near the drugs.

616
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:45,645
The wire is what gives us Barksdale.

617
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:47,921
It gives us the whole crew.

618
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:51,322
Day by day, piece by piece.

619
00:44:55,397 --> 00:44:58,025
Buy-bust, Lieutenant.

620
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:03,570
It's what I asked you for months ago.
It's what we do successfully...

621
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:06,964
time and again to make these cases.

622
00:45:14,383 --> 00:45:15,543
Why New York?

623
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:21,346
Must be something happening out there.
Too big a town, you know what I mean?

624
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:24,822
-You don't believe in the truce?
-That's why I asked for that money.

625
00:45:24,926 --> 00:45:27,690
If he had said,
"We ain't paying, just be happy to live"...

626
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:29,559
I'd have been like, they keeping it real.

627
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:33,395
But he say, come on down for $5,000.
I'm, like, man, please.

628
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:39,396
Look here, homes, I ain't asked for much,
but I'm a little light on traveling money.

629
00:45:40,242 --> 00:45:44,372
I'm saying, I could go around the block
and get myself paid, but I'm thinking.

630
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:51,385
You keep in touch with my pager.
We're gonna need you for the Gant trial.

631
00:45:52,454 --> 00:45:53,853
Go easy, Omar.

632
00:45:58,493 --> 00:46:00,085
Stay free.

633
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:07,164
You be picking me up outside
the cut-rate on Lex and Fulton.

634
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:09,527
I be up there after 10.:00, right?

635
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:11,236
That'll work.

636
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,264
Listen up, people.

637
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:17,303
We've got $30,000 in buy money,
courtesy of our friends over at DEA.

638
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:20,347
But the thing is,
they can't have that money walking on them.

639
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:21,746
Definitely not.

640
00:46:22,217 --> 00:46:25,584
So Kima will be in the car for the buy,
fronting as our Cl's girl.

641
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:27,416
Looking the part, too.

642
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:30,851
Now, where's your weapon gonna be?

643
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:33,427
He might pat me,
so it has to stash in the car.

644
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:36,019
I figure when Savino
gets in the car at the cut-rate...

645
00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:39,362
I'll be going in back.
It'll be up under the rear seat.

646
00:46:40,135 --> 00:46:43,104
And we probably can't be close enough
for an eyeball on this...

647
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:44,672
but the car will be a live wire.

648
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:48,106
And Kima will be throwing us
20s whenever she can. Rhonda.

649
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,371
I only want to remind Mr. Blocker here...

650
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:53,471
that his plea agreement
is contingent on cooperation.

651
00:46:53,582 --> 00:46:56,847
And a buy-bust on Savino Bratton
is less cooperative...

652
00:46:56,952 --> 00:46:59,785
than a buy-bust from someone
higher up on the food chain.

653
00:46:59,888 --> 00:47:02,448
If you can get Savino
talking about Avon or Stringer...

654
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:04,718
that's better for us and better for you.

655
00:47:04,826 --> 00:47:08,091
They already know that he got jacked
on a reverse buy, right?

656
00:47:08,196 --> 00:47:12,292
-Why wouldn't they assume he's snitching?
-I need money for a lawyer, right?

657
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,890
That's the story.

658
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:16,835
He got popped and now he needs
to get right back into it...

659
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:19,236
to pay the bondsman and the lawyer.

660
00:47:19,674 --> 00:47:22,438
All right. Let's make this work.

661
00:47:25,046 --> 00:47:27,947
Careful. That's my career
you're holding there.

662
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:31,410
-You got a unit?
-Parked in the mezzanine.

663
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,546
-Give me the keys, man.
-No, I'm driving, motherfucker.

664
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,452
Come on, man.

665
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:15,557
Death row here.

666
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:18,961
Ain't up.

667
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:21,730
Death row.

668
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:52,863
My girl. Half the money's hers.

669
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:07,944
Baby, since we going down North Avenue...

670
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:10,950
stop by the carry-out
so I can pick me up some cigarettes.

671
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:13,213
They're going up North, stay loose.

672
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:21,790
Shit. It's too loud.

673
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:41,939
Does any unit have the eyeball?

674
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:44,514
Negative, 1 1-35.

675
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:48,422
Come on, Greggs, tell us
where the fuck you are.

676
00:49:49,824 --> 00:49:51,416
Pull in there.

677
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,092
-What?
-Pull in there.

678
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:18,677
Don't fuck with this count.

679
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:23,088
I'll be right back with your shit.

680
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:35,736
Where are we?

681
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:38,772
That sign said Longwood,
but I could swear this was Warwick.

682
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:41,899
Hoppers be turning the sign poles
to fuck with you all.

683
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:49,309
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick,
in an alley....

684
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:52,875
I don't know, shit.
Half a block west of Longwood, maybe?

685
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:54,682
I hope you all copy that.

686
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:58,725
Yeah, that puts us about eight blocks away.
I'm pushing in a little closer.

687
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:00,317
All units be advised.

688
00:51:00,428 --> 00:51:04,057
Warwick near Longwood
in the north side alley. Or near that 20.

689
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:06,156
This got the right feel for you?

690
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:09,136
You creeping closer?

691
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:23,642
He better not be long,
because I don't know where the stash is...

692
00:51:23,752 --> 00:51:26,186
and if they dragging us all over
this part of town--

693
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:29,256
-What's that?
-What?

694
00:51:29,357 --> 00:51:30,688
Something ain't right.

695
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:33,124
-What?
-Shit ain't right.

696
00:51:36,264 --> 00:51:37,891
You snitching motherfucker.

697
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:40,024
Signal 13, signal 13!

698
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:41,159
Gunshots...

699
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:45,035
Gunshots. Go city-wide. 11-35.

700
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:47,602
Signal 13. Warwick...

701
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,472
near Longwood, officer down.

702
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:52,740
Two males, black hoodie,
both of them, one is--

703
00:51:53,548 --> 00:51:57,279
Signal 13, Warwick, near Longwood,
in the alleys. Check the alleys...

704
00:51:58,153 --> 00:52:00,383
Northside, 2800 block. Nothing.

705
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:04,683
We got an officer down,
she's a number one, female undercover.

706
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:10,161
Unit 833, bearing east
on 3100 block of Baker. Clear.

707
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:12,665
2900 is dark.

708
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:16,264
11-35, 10-38 is responding.

709
00:52:16,404 --> 00:52:17,371
10-4.

710
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:19,899
1 1-71, does anyone have a visual?

711
00:52:20,008 --> 00:52:21,669
Does anyone have a visual?

712
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,307
-Foxtrot.
-What are we looking for?

713
00:52:24,412 --> 00:52:25,879
1 1-35 to KGA.

714
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,210
We can't find the officer down.
We need Foxtrot...

715
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:32,353
Iooking for a green Lincoln Town Car with
a brown vinyl roof, parked in those alleys.

716
00:52:32,353 --> 00:52:33,217
Iooking for a green Lincoln Town Car with
a brown vinyl roof, parked in those alleys.

717
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:36,290
Foxtrot en route, 3-1-4.

718
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:39,827
3-14, be advised, we have a signal 13.

719
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,963
7820, rear odd-side.

720
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:45,794
3300 block of Baker. Clear.

721
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:50,730
Visual, rear even-side
of Warwick and Longwood.

722
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:55,031
Signal 13, signal 13. Officer down.

723
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:57,873
SUV, west on Warwick, make the next right.

724
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:12,416
Be advised, no movement at scene.

725
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:20,433
In here. Call for a medic.

726
00:53:26,074 --> 00:53:28,133
We got an officer down, we need a medic.

727
00:53:28,676 --> 00:53:31,873
7820, 10-23, give us DV in here.

728
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,078
10-4.

729
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,082
Where the fuck is the medic?

730
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:47,286
Signal 13, we got an officer down.

731
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:49,727
10-38 is responding.

732
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,374
Do we have a description?

733
00:54:01,476 --> 00:54:05,572
Any unit on scene?
Do you have a description of the suspect?

734
00:54:10,919 --> 00:54:13,183
That's a 10-47.
