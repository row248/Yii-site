1
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:16,107
How many shells you got?

2
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:17,739
Come on, come on!

3
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,411
Another bag here.

4
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,848
Christ.

5
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,252
Sergeant?

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,520
Yeah?

7
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:37,898
Who are the primaries?

8
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,569
Cole and Norris.

9
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:40,694
Cole's here...

10
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:43,239
and Norris is at the hospital.

11
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,911
What do you need?

12
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:47,701
Room to work.

13
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:50,215
I keep ordering people off the scene...

14
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:53,082
and between Narcotics,
DEA and the two districts...

15
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,019
we keep collecting more
and more bodies around here.

16
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,251
Nobody move!

17
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,354
I said, nobody fucking move!

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,797
If you haven't been assigned a specific task
by a homicide detective...

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,061
you need to step away
from this crime scene.

20
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,804
Is there anybody doesn't
understand a direct order?

21
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,637
If you have not specifically
been instructed otherwise...

22
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:24,180
then remove your useless
interfering asses from the area.

23
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:26,976
Now!

24
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:33,186
Slow this thing down to a crawl.

25
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,786
Give these bastards no chance
to fuck up in a meaningful way.

26
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,954
Okay.

27
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:45,736
Wedged all the way to the back.

28
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,330
She couldn't get to it.

29
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,531
She taped it up front...

30
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,612
but as soon as she put any weight
on these worn-ass car seats...

31
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,906
they pulled the tape off.

32
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,743
Gun slid back behind the mesh
as they drove, probably.

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,944
Christ.

34
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:04,217
Where was her support?

35
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,425
There were two follow cars
several blocks distant.

36
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,427
She got turned around in the alleys.

37
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,690
She gave her 20
as the north side of Warwick.

38
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,898
They went there on the shots?

39
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,295
The Foxtrot finally found her.

40
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,995
Hey, you got to be moving outta here.

41
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,335
So, we had two units
covering the north side...

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,907
and a helicopter up on top.

43
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,907
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.

44
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,181
Bunk.

45
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,228
Terry, Mike, come on.

46
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,494
What the fuck happened?

47
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,018
You didn't have an eyeball?

48
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,289
On those streets,
there's no way you can eyeball it.

49
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:02,156
-She threw out 20s as best she could.
-Understood, I'm just asking.

50
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,369
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.

51
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,597
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.

52
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,368
I gave your people that at the scene.

53
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,033
We're hitting his last knowns.

54
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,508
The set-up was more than him.

55
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,774
The casings are different calibers,
and her Glock was full up.

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,014
-How bad?
-Chest wound, no exit.

57
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,644
Through and through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.

58
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,656
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.

59
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,919
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.

60
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,062
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?

61
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,065
-Warwick, I think.
-Okay.

62
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,966
You've got the east well-covered...

63
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,505
-to the west is the rail bed.
-What did Foxtrot see?

64
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,336
Nothing moving except our units.

65
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,568
Lieutenant...

66
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,171
I know just how you feel.

67
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,143
This is the toughest job
a police commissioner has.

68
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,445
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.

69
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,246
This is Lieutenant Daniels.

70
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,388
Right, of course.

71
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,026
This entire department
stands behind Detective Greggs...

72
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,528
in every possible way.

73
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,024
I just thought you should know that.

74
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,058
Yes, sir.

75
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:19,805
Jaybird.

76
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,547
We have a runner.

77
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,650
Yeah, we're gonna need casts
of these two imprints.

78
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,624
Put the lab tech on it.

79
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,792
1 1-39.

80
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,629
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.

81
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,997
I'm not going to be standing...

82
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,333
giving a shit about the money
when you have lost...

83
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,769
one of your own who might....

84
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,704
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.

85
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,744
-If we can get to this Savino character--
-Hey.

86
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,838
Fuck your money.

87
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,884
Jimmy?

88
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,658
You hurt?

89
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,423
No.

90
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:19,726
It's hers.

91
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,669
Come on, get up.

92
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,411
Let's go, up with you.

93
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,306
Come on.

94
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,547
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.

95
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,285
Nothing.

96
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,154
She went into the ambo that way.

97
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,124
Is she....

98
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,967
What the fuck did I do?

99
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:52,768
Come on, walk.

100
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,440
What's that?

101
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,417
What's our plan, Ray?

102
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,151
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.

103
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,821
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office
typing warrants for Savino.

104
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,125
-Who's on the autopsy?
-Me, I'm at the morgue.

105
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:23,963
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma
in case she sits up and talks.

106
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,661
We're laser printing the car, right?

107
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,204
'Course, Worden's on that.

108
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,735
You're in command for the city, right?

109
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,241
Major Rawls, Homicide.

110
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,476
Anything you need from my office...

111
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,140
men, money, whatever, you just ask.

112
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:39,777
Right.

113
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,025
Cooperator, your girl's down
in shock trauma.

114
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,960
Let's get to work.

115
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:56,993
Fuck you.

116
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,091
Fuck me?

117
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,729
We got a wire up.

118
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:00,894
So?

119
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:03,873
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker
that just shot a cop.

120
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,103
If somebody talks,
and gets on the wrong phone...

121
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,042
says the wrong thing
about what happened...

122
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,172
where the fuck do you want to be?

123
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:13,781
Church roof?

124
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,018
Yeah, you and me.

125
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,655
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.

126
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,119
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?

127
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:23,819
Shit.

128
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,259
I'll do that first,
then meet you at the church.

129
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,272
Bunk, Mike.

130
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,599
Wonder who that bitch was.

131
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,003
-Always some shit, right?
-Yeah.

132
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,769
-Done?
-Done.

133
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:11,876
All right.

134
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:13,875
Let's get outta here.

135
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,045
Yeah.

136
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,255
Lab tech to this spot.

137
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,689
Photos and casts.

138
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,954
1-39.

139
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,187
11-35.

140
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,625
Can I get 18-1 2 up here?

141
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,660
Yeah.

142
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:42,132
You're camped here.

143
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,802
Nobody touches this shit,
or even comes near it...

144
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,571
until the tech does his recovery.

145
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,283
Hello.

146
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:01,620
He stopped running.

147
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:04,761
Either he got tired or--

148
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,228
Or he got into a car.

149
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,788
Right.

150
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,027
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 11-34.

151
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,261
I'm in the...

152
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,401
3000 block of Landvale.

153
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,741
Backing up to the CSX bed.

154
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,209
I need a lab unit,
and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.

155
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:21,968
A jackhammer?

156
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,682
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.

157
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,188
Alive. In the OR.

158
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,052
My people at the scene have heard this.

159
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,750
-It's a copy of the original.
-Okay.

160
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,955
We brought a machine--

161
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,118
-Where the fuck is--
-Sir.

162
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,287
Here it is, here.

163
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:41,126
Yeah, put it there.

164
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,147
Don't fuck with this count.

165
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:55,476
Don't fuck with this count.

166
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:56,736
That's Savino.

167
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,713
I'll be right back with your shit.

168
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,274
Where are we?

169
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,720
That sign said Longwood,
but I could swear this is Warwick.

170
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:07,348
Hoppers be turning the sign poles
to fuck with you all.

171
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,294
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick,
in an alley, I don't know, shit...

172
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,566
half a block west of Longwood, maybe?

173
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,164
I hope you all copy that.

174
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,963
This got the right feel for you?

175
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,265
He better not be long,
'cause I don't know where the stash is...

176
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,637
and if they dragging us all over
this part of town--

177
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,834
What's that?

178
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,104
Jesus.

179
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,837
-Something ain't right.
-What?

180
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:29,971
This shit ain't right.

181
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,276
Christ.

182
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,852
Signal 13, signal 13.

183
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,418
What the fuck?

184
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,915
She can't reach the gun.

185
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,750
-What the fuck?
-Two males, black hoodies, both of them--

186
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,185
Shut it off.

187
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,696
Shut it off.

188
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,743
Dr. Mells, Line 6.

189
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,081
Listen to me, you fuck.

190
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,349
You did a lot of shit here.

191
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,720
You played a lot of fucking cards
and made a lot of people...

192
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,024
do a lot of fucking things
they didn't want to do.

193
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,759
This is true.

194
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,000
We both know this is true.

195
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,896
Dr. Ralston, please call cardiology.

196
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,599
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.

197
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,774
We both know this.

198
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,505
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.

199
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,645
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here...

200
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:39,717
and say you did a single fucking thing
to get a police shot.

201
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,480
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?

202
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,622
This is not on you.

203
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,752
No, it isn't, asshole.

204
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,323
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.

205
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,221
And the motherfucker saying this...

206
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,955
he hates your guts, McNulty.

207
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,361
So you know if it was on you...

208
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,767
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.

209
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:05,267
Shit went bad.

210
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,940
She took two for the company.

211
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,978
That's the only lesson here.

212
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,184
Police!

213
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,021
Police, let me see your hands.

214
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,116
-Get on the ground!
-Down on the ground!

215
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:24,188
Search warrant, get on the ground.

216
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,321
Police, get down.

217
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,327
Let's see your hands.

218
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,829
-He ain't here!
-Who ain't here?

219
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,905
-Zach, he ain't here!
-Zach?

220
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,906
No, honey, we're looking for Savino.

221
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,199
Savino?

222
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,573
No, he's my baby.

223
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,976
Yeah, your baby shot a cop.

224
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,150
They're kicking in the doors,
looking for Savino.

225
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:50,380
-What? What up with that, man?
-Some shit about he killed a cop.

226
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,513
Who, Savino?

227
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,885
Savino ain't shot no cop.

228
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,152
They kicking in the doors,
acting like he did it.

229
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,091
-Shit.
-I'm telling you, man.

230
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,391
They're talking about it anyway.

231
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,328
Ripples in the pond.

232
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,458
Talking ain't knowing, is it?

233
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,869
Skin this cat another way.

234
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,404
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?

235
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,240
Only this one after the shooting.

236
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,773
Who's 07?

237
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:21,085
And what phone is he asking
for Stringer to call him back?

238
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,822
-Shit went good, but--
-Hold on.

239
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,397
Officer was shot around 12.:30 this morning.

240
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,693
The officer may have been undercover.

241
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,833
-All right, talk.
-Like I said, it went good...

242
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,432
except there was this bitch
curled up in the back seat.

243
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,136
Surprised the shit out of us.

244
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,012
Didn't even see her
until the shit popped off.

245
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,141
I mean if it was up to me,
I'd have let the girl walk.

246
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:55,185
She didn't look like the talking type.

247
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,518
But Little Man seen her,
bugged out, and let a couple go.

248
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:01,524
-Savino didn't tip y'all off to her?
-Wasn't no time for that.

249
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,924
He get up out the car,
we see him go up the block...

250
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,257
Iike we said, right?

251
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,055
After that, he out of sight
and we bring it home like we planned, baby.

252
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,033
Shorty was a cop.

253
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,605
And she ain't dead.

254
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,037
Where'd you all put the guns?

255
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,181
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.

256
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,309
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?

257
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,322
-A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
-What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?

258
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,121
I mean, this motherfucker
bugged out one time.

259
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,459
He gonna bug out again,
when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?

260
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:40,826
I mean, come on, man.

261
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:43,492
Savino got a story that
he can keep to and he know it...

262
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,571
but Little Man, he always
been fucking weak like that.

263
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,705
Little Man gotta go.

264
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,469
You hear me?

265
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,876
This shit gonna get real heavy.

266
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,813
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.

267
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,384
I wanna see how it go
with this Savino bullshit...

268
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,215
see how they go past that.

269
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:04,885
But if the shit don't hold...

270
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,187
or if this motherfucking cop
wake up and start talking shit...

271
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,954
then you gotta go sky up.

272
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,530
Where you got your peoples at?

273
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,526
New York.

274
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,167
Jersey, Cleveland.

275
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,171
All right. So, Philly.

276
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,864
DC.

277
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:26,603
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.

278
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,036
You feel me, right?

279
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:31,541
All right. We gotta be careful.

280
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,852
Jesus.

281
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,329
Look, I'm sorry.

282
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,466
It's all right, you just scared me.

283
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,603
I work with Kima.

284
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,868
Kima, she....

285
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,911
Kima's at work.

286
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,243
What is she?

287
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,465
Dust the receiver, the coin return,
and the metal top.

288
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,439
The can, too.

289
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,646
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.

290
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,690
We can't really know for sure.

291
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,289
Lieutenant.

292
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,160
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and--

293
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:01,501
Maybe somebody
from the department or the city...

294
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,005
maybe might want to say something.

295
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,541
Who's here from the family?

296
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,276
A daughter, you say?

297
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,469
A daughter?

298
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,473
Officer Greggs has a girl?

299
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,745
A roommate.

300
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,154
The family's in Richmond,
driving up first thing today...

301
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,224
but the roommate's already here.

302
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,673
I'll do it myself.

303
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,604
No problem.

304
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,342
If we lose her,
he can always pose for the funeral.

305
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,239
Still need the right door for Savino.

306
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:51,179
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama,
all empty holes.

307
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:54,115
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs
on one of the hoodies.

308
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,083
That's something.

309
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,416
So, either these guys
are neighborhood yos...

310
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,923
who lucked into $30,000
on a street stickup, or....

311
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,290
Or they're pros who set up in an alley
on one side of the tracks...

312
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,160
then slip over to the other side...

313
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,755
where they park their ride.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,160
What about the post?

315
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:13,328
Cause and manner of death
on Mr. Blocker is homicide...

316
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,932
to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder,
chest and left arm.

317
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,870
Nine millimeter, six left twist,
suitable for comparison.

318
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,778
We pulled something else
from the back seat of the car, right?

319
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,943
Yeah, .380. Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.

320
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,953
So, we confirmed the two shooters.

321
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,120
Print hit.

322
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,588
Wynton "Little Man" Rice,
enforcer in the 221 ...

323
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,956
a definite connect to Barksdale's world.

324
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,485
Print hit?

325
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,028
Print hit from what?

326
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:40,653
Soda can.

327
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:43,456
Dropped at the pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere.

328
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,661
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.

329
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,364
What is this pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere?

330
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,964
It's from which some
motherfucker paged Stringer Bell...

331
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,600
20 minutes after the shooting.

332
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,941
I dusted the phone, too,
but it was smudged.

333
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,209
So we got a Barksdale pro
in the northwest...

334
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,717
ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.

335
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,649
So much for the amateur-hour theory.

336
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,786
Good pull. You are?

337
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,889
Freamon. Lester Freamon.

338
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,358
Where you working?

339
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,660
Pawn shop unit.

340
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,800
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police?

341
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,599
Ain't no percentage in that,
know what I'm saying?

342
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:22,764
For real.

343
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,675
Someone around here do that shit...

344
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,802
every narco in the world
be down here busting heads.

345
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:32,104
I guess them Park Heights niggers
just ain't got no fucking common sense.

346
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,317
A lotta heart, just no sense.

347
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,653
Poot.

348
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,988
Wallace on the phone.

349
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,224
-Yeah?
-Wallace?

350
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,894
Nigger ring me up twice a day
whether he got shit to say or not.

351
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,692
-Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
-Where's he at?

352
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,758
At the shore with his grandma,
down there....

353
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:55,430
Surfing or some bullshit.

354
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,334
Or something.

355
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:01,073
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on Line 5.

356
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,145
You just use that phone?

357
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,472
Yeah, a little earlier.

358
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,415
-You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
-Just now, you used it?

359
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,610
Yeah.

360
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,585
-A man downtown needs to talk to you.
-Man downtown?

361
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,325
Make some sense for this man, please.
All right?

362
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,452
-I ain't never been so clean in my life.
-I'm just doing my job.

363
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,588
Okay.

364
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,701
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?

365
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,467
No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.

366
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,199
My grandmother on the bayside.

367
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,904
Still, man, you on vacation
and not bringing me with you.

368
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,673
How you get all the way down there?

369
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,805
I took a bus.

370
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,406
Shit, tell me how to go,
and I grab a 'hound, too.

371
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,281
Come down there and hang with your ass.

372
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:18,184
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.

373
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,722
Worse than Baltimore.

374
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,925
And these crickets,
louder than a motherfucker.

375
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,653
I can't get no sleep.

376
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:27,559
I don't think I'm cut out
to be no country-ass nigger, man.

377
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:31,101
Please deposit two dollars
for an additional two minutes.

378
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:32,134
Shit, I gotta go.

379
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,206
You can take a nigger out the Westside.
But you can't take--

380
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:04,962
What's your name?

381
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,926
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?

382
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,927
I asked you your name.

383
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,700
No, this shit ain't right.

384
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,399
Who'd you try to page, shit bird?

385
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:18,204
Why the fuck do you care, okay?

386
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:19,437
I mean....

387
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:26,549
You have exactly three more seconds
to explain yourself to me, asshole.

388
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:32,453
One shooter definitely
opened the passenger door...

389
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:34,856
so any latent prints
from that side of the car....

390
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:38,595
-Why'd you page her, shit bird?
-Get off me.

391
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,256
You think this is a fucking game?

392
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,800
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.

393
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:46,838
-You can't, motherfucker.
-Then McNulty then. This shit ain't right, sir.

394
00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:55,438
Savino.

395
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,014
Mope ain't around.

396
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,050
One of them low-rise hoppers...

397
00:26:09,228 --> 00:26:10,388
on Tower Phone 2.

398
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:11,485
Okay.

399
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,505
Maybe he forgot the number.

400
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,321
The fuck was that?

401
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:40,987
You don't know?

402
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:44,389
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.

403
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,998
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.

404
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,599
Put that away.

405
00:26:57,844 --> 00:27:00,312
Put that away and work the case.

406
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,571
Can I ask you something?

407
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:15,623
How much of this case would you
give up to get her back?

408
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:17,824
That's not the point.

409
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,919
How much?

410
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,867
All of it.

411
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,095
But it doesn't work that way.

412
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:26,671
You can't give it back.

413
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:36,204
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report
that shows no fucking progress.

414
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,883
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse...

415
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:42,420
and if she's got a shred of luck...

416
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:45,457
the shot she took to the neck
didn't catch any spine.

417
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:50,928
It wasn't worth it.

418
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:57,298
Homicide for McNulty on Line 2.

419
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:09,273
Do your job.

420
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:22,528
Yeah?

421
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,095
So how you doing with it?

422
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:25,786
I'll live.

423
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:27,292
Yeah?

424
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:29,162
Listen, Jimmy.

425
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:32,127
We had a little dust-up over here.

426
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:37,539
Holley might have beat
one of your girl's Cls on spec.

427
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,804
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?

428
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:42,673
Yeah, that's him.

429
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,413
You might wanna roll past
and squelch this shit...

430
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:46,951
before it gets outta hand.

431
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,109
Yeah.

432
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:57,222
It ain't worth it, man.

433
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,355
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.

434
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:01,194
A fucking cop, man. A cop!

435
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:05,201
How stupid is this motherfucker?
lf you see a bitch in the car, change it up.

436
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:07,135
We can go to Orlando another fucking day.

437
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:09,867
Savino say he was trying to signal,
but he in the dark...

438
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:11,568
he don't know where Bey's coming from.

439
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:12,666
Nothing breaking our way.

440
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:14,939
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money.

441
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,571
It's probably marked somehow.

442
00:29:17,116 --> 00:29:19,744
The guns are in the sewer,
Bey's a rock, so that's cool.

443
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:20,819
But it's the bitch cop.

444
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,185
If she starts talking,
she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.

445
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,848
What up with Little Man?

446
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:28,619
-He's scared. He shot a cop.
-Fuck.

447
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:30,252
But I put Bey on that.

448
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:33,526
What about Savino?

449
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,429
Savino, he gotta eat the charge.

450
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:36,626
But he knew that.

451
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:39,364
So if he keep his story tight,
he gonna be all right.

452
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,971
We knew Orlando was
a snitching motherfucker, man.

453
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:44,542
Fuck him, but this is cash.
He got us caught up.

454
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:47,044
I know, man. That's my fault, man.

455
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:49,807
Bey and Savino came to me
with the idea that...

456
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,145
if they take Orlando,
they can take the cash, too.

457
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:54,446
I was like, all right, you all get your payday--

458
00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:57,852
How the fuck is Orlando
gonna front this type of cash?

459
00:29:58,457 --> 00:29:59,754
What it say?

460
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:00,791
I know.

461
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:02,494
I know, I fucked up.

462
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,026
All right, take this trash outside,
fucking burn it.

463
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:11,225
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess
before he jet.

464
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,703
He was throwing
91 1 messages to her pager.

465
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:21,540
I asked him why.

466
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:23,442
He raised up.

467
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:25,843
Shit got outta hand.

468
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:29,881
Does he know?

469
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,693
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there, man?

470
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,586
He just started beating on me.

471
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:39,856
Last night, she got shot.

472
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,797
Where the fuck were you at?

473
00:30:42,902 --> 00:30:44,836
-Where were you?
-I was there.

474
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:48,340
Bunk.

475
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:50,568
Holley is investigating.

476
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:53,674
We got no good latents
on the passenger side door.

477
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:56,009
...and he sees her pager coming up 91 1 .

478
00:30:56,282 --> 00:30:57,442
What about the dash?

479
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,178
You gotta help me!

480
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:00,609
Call the lab.

481
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:06,852
What can I do?

482
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,818
For one thing you can roll around
the projects and see who's missing.

483
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:13,897
Who ain't around.

484
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,566
You okay with that?

485
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,334
Yeah, I just....

486
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:22,837
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?

487
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:25,440
Ain't been around the projects much lately.

488
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:27,239
You know what I'm saying?

489
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:29,211
You beefing with someone down there?

490
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,777
No, I'm not beefing with....

491
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,356
Eyes open, Bubbs.

492
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:43,784
For Kima.

493
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,393
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.

494
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:53,270
Where are we with Savino?

495
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:56,206
-Still MIA.
-Enough of this bullshit.

496
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:01,603
If he calls me for anything,
I'll tell him to turn himself in.

497
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,806
-I'm going to do that.
-Not good enough.

498
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:05,208
Excuse me?

499
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:06,881
We need him now.

500
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:10,946
No, thanks.

501
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,181
Perhaps as an officer of the court...

502
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:14,987
Ronnie here is being polite.

503
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:17,062
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.

504
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:19,859
She's putting it into
your twisted little language. Me?

505
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,456
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with a Baltimore lawyer.

506
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:24,227
No offense.

507
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,363
None taken.

508
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:29,969
I mean, I'm willing
to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury...

509
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,873
blow smoke up a judge's ass
and jury-tamper your balls off...

510
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:35,913
without losing the slightest bit
of my sunny disposition.

511
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:40,049
Fuck me if I don't let you structure
your cash into briefcase fees, either.

512
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,950
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend, right?

513
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,756
What Jimmy is trying to say is--

514
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,351
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want
my nose closed to your shit...

515
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:52,555
you have to throw me something
when I need it.

516
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:55,759
And right now I need Savino Bratton
in bracelets.

517
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:58,034
I don't know where he is.

518
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,161
You repped him the last four felonies.

519
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,433
I guess you can get word to him
if you want to.

520
00:33:05,077 --> 00:33:08,513
A police may die, Morrie,
and Savino was there.

521
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:11,311
He comes in this afternoon...

522
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:13,248
and he takes the drug charge at least.

523
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:14,578
Or what?

524
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:18,956
Or we send tactical teams
into his momma's house every night...

525
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,992
until there's no house left to worry about.

526
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,024
You get a target letter
from the state's attorney's office...

527
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,222
followed by subpoenas
for every bank account...

528
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:27,560
in your fucking name.

529
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,500
And let's see if all those cash deposits
match the reported income.

530
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,666
I'm hearing this from him...

531
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:39,603
and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.

532
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:43,780
Am I hearing this from
the state's attorney's office as well?

533
00:33:47,987 --> 00:33:48,976
You are.

534
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:53,323
I'll see what I can do.

535
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:57,559
Fuck you, Jimmy!

536
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:00,827
-You didn't tell me that was coming.
-He'll bring him in.

537
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:04,130
-He will if he can, that's not the point.
-What's the point?

538
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:08,468
The point is that Morrie Levy is a past
officer of the Monumental Bar Association...

539
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:11,505
and unless I want
to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA...

540
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,170
I can't spend my afternoons
pissing on people who matter.

541
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,077
Another career in the balance.

542
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:20,852
-Fuck you.
-No, fuck you.

543
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:24,378
If only half of you
in the state's attorney's office...

544
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,616
didn't want to be judges...

545
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,988
didn't want to be partners
in a downtown law firm...

546
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:31,654
if you had the balls to follow through,
you know what would happen?

547
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:34,358
A guy like that would be indicted,
tried and convicted.

548
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:35,899
The rest of them would back up...

549
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:38,435
so we could push a clean case
through your courthouse.

550
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:41,335
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.

551
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:43,441
And everybody's got a fucking future.

552
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:47,873
You'll just use anyone, won't you?

553
00:34:56,188 --> 00:35:00,352
I've been searching the logs for pager hits
that used an 07 code, right?

554
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:03,023
It comes up now and then
on D'Angelo's pager.

555
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:05,354
Stringer's, too, but less often.

556
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:08,562
Most of the time,
there's nothing to place the guy...

557
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,095
but check it.

558
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:14,834
-And this is on Stringer's page?
-It comes back to the pay phone...

559
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,500
in the emergency room
at Maryland General Hospital.

560
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,002
Let me guess.

561
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:22,478
The date of this page
is the same day that Stinkum got killed.

562
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:25,183
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.

563
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,248
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.

564
00:35:27,353 --> 00:35:30,754
If you go to Maryland General
and pull the ER records for that morning...

565
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:32,585
you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.

566
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:34,087
07 is Wee-Bey.

567
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,527
It's gotta be.

568
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:41,224
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man
at the pay phone at Park Heights...

569
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,994
20 minutes after the ambush...

570
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,434
throwing a page to Stringer.

571
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,799
We're all over town
for this piece-of-shit Savino.

572
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:52,136
With ties to the Barksdale organization?

573
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:54,277
-Yes, sir.
-What else?

574
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:57,008
The case is progressing.

575
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,917
We're gleaning
possible shooters from the wiretap.

576
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:01,644
I asked for the controlled buy.

577
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:04,121
I put one of our people in harm's way.

578
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,256
So right now I want to make sure
that we are doing everything.

579
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,487
-We are, sir, we're on it.
-Good.

580
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,563
The commissioner wants raids citywide.

581
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,057
Every door we can take.

582
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:17,966
Any addresses we can write on,
anything connected to a narcotics case.

583
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,868
CID, tactical, the DEUs...

584
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:23,339
and tomorrow, on the 6:00 news...

585
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:26,609
we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.

586
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:27,736
A lot of it.

587
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:30,439
Dope on the table?

588
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:32,876
We need to let them know who we are.

589
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:36,119
We can't for one minute let them
think that this will stand.

590
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:41,621
The Commissioner wants
to send a message, Lieutenant.

591
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:44,393
You make sure you and your people...

592
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:46,964
do everything possible
to see that it is heard.

593
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:57,638
Dope on the damn table.

594
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:00,642
It's like the man said.

595
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,111
We're letting them know who we are.

596
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:04,307
Yeah?

597
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,815
And who the hell are we?

598
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:18,129
Again, for the record, let's make clear
that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized...

599
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,290
and that what is said here
is for purposes of a proffer.

600
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,992
-Agreed?
-Agreed.

601
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,357
Okay, then.

602
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,359
Here you go.

603
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:34,970
That's baking soda.

604
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:38,614
Which Mr. Bratton intended
to sell to Orlando Blocker.

605
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,617
You can keep it with our compliments.

606
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,719
Where's the money?

607
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:44,652
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.

608
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,384
He left it in the car
when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.

609
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:51,622
If you were recording the transaction,
the tape will confirm this.

610
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:53,831
And he wasn't around
for the shooting either.

611
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:55,559
He doesn't know who the shooters are.

612
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,498
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.

613
00:37:57,803 --> 00:37:59,395
I mean, it was pure dumb luck...

614
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,372
that he left them in an dead-end alley
and they were shot...

615
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:03,600
just two minutes later.

616
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:05,040
This is bullshit.

617
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:06,777
A police is down.

618
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:12,346
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge
that the young woman was a police officer.

619
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:17,849
And no intention of doing anything other
than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.

620
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:21,223
Ms. Nathan?

621
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,427
No charge if he gives us the shooters.

622
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:26,994
And if he testifies...

623
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,227
we'll find a way to squeeze him
into the federal witness program.

624
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:31,762
As I indicated...

625
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,169
Mr. Bratton has no idea
who shot Mr. Blocker...

626
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,139
or the undercover officer.

627
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:41,770
Best you can do is 286B.

628
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:44,815
What the hell is that?

629
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,612
Distribution of sham CDS.

630
00:38:46,718 --> 00:38:49,448
Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.

631
00:38:50,055 --> 00:38:51,181
That's it?

632
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,282
If he took the cash,
we could go to felony theft or fraud...

633
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:56,724
but the tape has him leaving the money.

634
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,029
Three years.

635
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:01,957
A cop was shot, Morrie.

636
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:05,059
So if we convict,
he'll do every damn day of the three.

637
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,297
I can do the three. Ain't no thing.

638
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:09,906
And the $5,000 fine?

639
00:39:10,342 --> 00:39:12,742
Shit, you still up $25,000, right?

640
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,647
Nicely done.

641
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:29,917
Give me two.

642
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,893
Damn, Orlando.

643
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,430
I still can't believe that shit.

644
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:12,529
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.

645
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:13,969
Who the fuck was he?

646
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,404
-He ran a club for my uncle.
-Yeah?

647
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:20,137
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.

648
00:40:20,512 --> 00:40:23,640
Yeah, man, and I heard the cops
been all in Savino's shit, too.

649
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:25,944
-He ain't been around.
-Little Man, neither.

650
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:29,309
Somebody could get
to cleaning up shit around here.

651
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:30,410
True.

652
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:33,385
You can't just be going around,
dropping 5-0 like that.

653
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:36,427
You know how your uncle is when
people get to fucking up, man.

654
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:38,688
He starts taking that shit personal, man.

655
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:41,795
Look like a couple more niggers
gonna get dropped.

656
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:43,223
What up?

657
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:44,335
You Dee?

658
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:45,425
Yeah.

659
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:47,971
They say you need to get with Stringer,
right away.

660
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:51,398
See?

661
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,540
You moving up in the world.

662
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:57,510
As long as you don't fall in
with the trash they taking out.

663
00:40:57,883 --> 00:40:59,180
Yeah, whatever, nigger.

664
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:01,011
I'll be right back.

665
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:03,983
Tower boys all nervous and shit.

666
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:06,154
Little Man ain't post for work.

667
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,325
Ain't answering his page, neither.

668
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:10,684
See?

669
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:13,592
I'm not gonna lie.

670
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:17,033
She has swelling around the vertebrae...

671
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:19,330
and some indications of partial paralysis.

672
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:22,639
That may or may not go away
when the swelling goes down.

673
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:24,406
Her family is with her.

674
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:26,507
What the fuck is up with Homicide?

675
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:28,445
Are we on the shooters yet?

676
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:30,080
They're working it hard.

677
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:34,548
The departmental response is gonna be
to take doors tomorrow morning.

678
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:35,551
Citywide.

679
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:38,184
Every unit, every district is kicking in...

680
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,281
any drug-connected address
they can write on.

681
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:41,859
We're gonna do the same.

682
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,822
-Lieutenant, is that--
-Except...

683
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,991
we're gonna hold back on the main stash.

684
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,498
The house up in northwest
we tracked off the wire....

685
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:52,764
We advance this case more
by sitting on that location.

686
00:41:52,871 --> 00:41:55,396
And raids that are too much
on the bulls-eye...

687
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:57,202
will have Barksdale changing up.

688
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,106
We might blow the wire altogether.

689
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:03,075
We got two addresses in the low-rises
that are probables...

690
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:04,944
and another two row houses...

691
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,780
that have been used for stash
as recently as last week.

692
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,382
But this....

693
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:12,485
this here is the best bet for a good rip.

694
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,220
Herc picked up on it yesterday.

695
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:17,819
Fourth-floor...

696
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:20,397
end unit on the south side of the 221 .

697
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,490
They're dropping the re-ups
out the window...

698
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:23,932
to the hoppers who run it off.

699
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:25,696
What if they change up the apartment?

700
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:27,294
They do that every day.

701
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:29,636
Yesterday was the fifth floor
on the north side.

702
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,936
We'll have a man on the church
with a cell phone.

703
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:36,377
They change up, we call the duty judge
who orally amends the warrant.

704
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:39,049
We hit everything at 1 1 :00.

705
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:42,649
The squad that takes the high-rise
needs to stage at 5:00.

706
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:45,719
We need to be inside before
the building even wakes up.

707
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:50,758
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight
needs to start typing his ass off right now.

708
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:55,156
What's up?

709
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:57,557
Why ain't the club open?

710
00:42:58,703 --> 00:42:59,829
You going with Bey.

711
00:43:00,872 --> 00:43:01,896
Bey.

712
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:05,135
Keep it clean.

713
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:06,710
Don't make no mistakes.

714
00:43:16,955 --> 00:43:17,944
Going where?

715
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,255
What the fuck you waiting for?

716
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:48,813
Stop bullshitting me.

717
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:07,197
The main stash.

718
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:08,867
He knows we're on it.

719
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:10,573
He knows we held it back.

720
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:11,900
The Deputy.

721
00:44:13,178 --> 00:44:16,147
We grab a senator's bag man
in the projects, he knows that.

722
00:44:16,248 --> 00:44:18,682
State Police bring in a cooperator,
he knows it, too.

723
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:19,909
Like fucking clockwork.

724
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:21,110
He's got a rat.

725
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,178
Here, in the detail.

726
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,088
In the beginning...

727
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:31,890
when we started, Burrell had me.

728
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,795
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.

729
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,431
But now he lost you.

730
00:44:38,336 --> 00:44:40,236
So now he's picked up someone else.

731
00:44:40,872 --> 00:44:42,271
That's how they do.

732
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:11,558
Can we talk?

733
00:45:13,138 --> 00:45:14,867
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

734
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,537
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.

735
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:20,702
What now?

736
00:45:20,812 --> 00:45:22,279
We're on a prime location.

737
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,642
Barksdale's stash.

738
00:45:23,782 --> 00:45:27,343
Instead of making cases, he wants us
to write a paper and take the door.

739
00:45:27,452 --> 00:45:29,352
-Why?
-Dope on the table.

740
00:45:29,454 --> 00:45:33,356
It's a photo op to make us feel better
about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.

741
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,516
Christ.

742
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:37,153
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.

743
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,695
I don't know, Jimmy.

744
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:45,625
You back on the ticket, huh?

745
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,436
It was just the usual bullshit.

746
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:55,673
They're just dicking me around...

747
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:59,074
trying to get another black face,
make it four-and-one...

748
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:00,412
to even up for the last time.

749
00:46:00,518 --> 00:46:03,078
The Governor had to promise
two new appointments.

750
00:46:03,188 --> 00:46:05,179
So now we're back where we were.

751
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,416
That's all it was.

752
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:09,153
That's all?

753
00:46:10,428 --> 00:46:12,123
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.

754
00:46:13,264 --> 00:46:15,198
It has nothing to do with your case.

755
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:18,365
I need you on this.

756
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:28,837
So, who's my daddy now?

757
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:41,417
I just do what the fuck
they tell me, you know?

758
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,423
It ain't on me to know
what the fuck they have in mind.

759
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:47,787
Look, Bey.

760
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:50,129
Now it come down to this crazy shit.

761
00:46:52,804 --> 00:46:55,295
Turn in this alley right here. Right there.

762
00:47:07,218 --> 00:47:09,448
What the fuck you stopping for? Go!

763
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,774
Inside, man. Let's go.

764
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:38,906
This dude is crazy.

765
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:46,851
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.

766
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:04,941
Man, get in here.

767
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:17,481
Go ahead, man.

768
00:48:17,822 --> 00:48:19,084
What's wrong with you?

769
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,060
Check it out, Dee.

770
00:48:38,276 --> 00:48:40,676
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.

771
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:45,808
You gonna give them different food
for each tank, too, all right?

772
00:48:48,253 --> 00:48:51,586
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do. Come here.

773
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,949
These are my Tetras.

774
00:48:57,428 --> 00:49:02,058
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey
and Jezebel in here somewhere.

775
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:03,896
I don't know, she think she cute.

776
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:08,032
You take two pinches of whatever food
I got next to each tank.

777
00:49:08,406 --> 00:49:09,896
They set for the day.

778
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:13,276
You see, they ain't no problems.

779
00:49:13,611 --> 00:49:15,476
Just beautiful as hell, Dee.

780
00:49:15,613 --> 00:49:17,808
I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.

781
00:49:20,285 --> 00:49:21,274
Bey.

782
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,714
Where we going, man?

783
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:26,719
Philly. You gonna take the truck back...

784
00:49:26,825 --> 00:49:31,091
but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit,
show you what to do with my tanks, right?

785
00:49:31,196 --> 00:49:32,185
Philly?

786
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:35,158
We shot a narco, Dee.

787
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:27,148
No Savino.

788
00:50:27,252 --> 00:50:29,447
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.

789
00:50:30,622 --> 00:50:33,386
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit...

790
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:35,549
he's out the mix, too.

791
00:50:36,895 --> 00:50:38,658
You think it was them that did it?

792
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,891
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.

793
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,933
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.

794
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:45,932
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers...

795
00:50:46,037 --> 00:50:48,096
and miles of NCIC bullshit.

796
00:50:48,206 --> 00:50:49,833
Warrants for blood and hair, too.

797
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:52,171
It's Bey and Little Man,
shooter one and two.

798
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:53,505
I feel it, Bunk.

799
00:50:53,611 --> 00:50:54,771
Yeah?

800
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:57,840
Right now, we need our girl to wake up...

801
00:50:57,949 --> 00:50:59,041
and say so.

802
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:00,706
All right.

803
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,880
You did good, Bubbs.

804
00:51:04,656 --> 00:51:06,055
McNulty, you know...

805
00:51:07,258 --> 00:51:09,089
the situation is different for me.

806
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:11,559
-I mean, for me, I'm--
-Mount up.

807
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,092
I gotta go.

808
00:51:18,603 --> 00:51:20,366
Prez will get you a ride, okay?

809
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:40,151
Move out.

810
00:52:02,046 --> 00:52:03,104
Police.

811
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:05,214
Police! Go!

812
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:07,943
Show your hands, asshole!

813
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:10,383
Down on the ground. Move it, move it!

814
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:13,587
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.

815
00:52:13,691 --> 00:52:14,953
-Clear?
-All clear.

816
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,428
-Bathroom's clear.
-Check the mattress.

817
00:52:18,529 --> 00:52:22,431
Check under the bed, check all the drawers,
check every fucking inch of this room.

818
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,737
-Got anything?
-No.

819
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:31,966
Bingo.

820
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:39,913
Got it. There she goes.

821
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:41,841
Bag it.

822
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:49,915
Let's do it.

823
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:30,998
That's fine police work, Erv.

824
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:35,596
Ladies and gentlemen...

825
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,899
what you see on the table in front ofyou...

826
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:41,740
represents our department's answer
to a culture of death and drugs.

827
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,810
And when an officer falls in this war...

828
00:53:45,316 --> 00:53:48,046
others stand ready
to pick up the challenge...

829
00:53:48,152 --> 00:53:51,178
and carry the fight
to the very doorstep of those responsible.

830
00:53:52,056 --> 00:53:54,320
This is only the beginning,
I can assure you.

831
00:53:54,492 --> 00:53:58,223
But today, a message has been sent.

832
00:53:58,963 --> 00:54:02,296
And believe me, this message
is being heard loud and clear...

833
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:05,363
by all those who seek profit and power...

834
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,538
in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.

835
00:54:09,474 --> 00:54:10,532
Slow.

836
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:14,135
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone,
nothing on the towers.

837
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:16,079
Who's on the rooftop?

838
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:17,674
No one.

839
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:20,806
Fuck it.

840
00:54:23,254 --> 00:54:24,721
Where's the money, man?

841
00:54:24,822 --> 00:54:27,416
-How much you need?
-The bus cost like $18, man.

842
00:54:27,592 --> 00:54:28,718
Your grandma ain't got it?

843
00:54:28,826 --> 00:54:31,260
If I ask her, she gonna try
to stop me from booking.

844
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:35,093
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.

845
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:37,867
I'm saying, you need to send me
something for the bus.

846
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,365
Yeah, I feel you.

847
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:44,032
-When do you want to come home?
-When the money get here.

848
00:54:44,142 --> 00:54:46,201
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.

849
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:57,201
